{"prompt": "  The noise of signals or currents consisting from a sequence of pulses,\nelementary events or moving discrete objects (particles) is analyzed. A simple\nanalytically solvable model is investigated in detail both analytically and\nnumerically. It is shown that 1/f noise may result from the statistics of the\npulses transit times with random increments of the time intervals between the\npulses. The model also serves as a basis for revealing parameter dependences of\n1/f noise and allows one to make some generalizations. As a result the\nintensity of 1/f noise is expressed through the distribution and characteristic\nfunctions of the time intervals between the subsequent transit times of the\npulses. The conclusion that 1/f noise may result from the clustering of the\nsignal pulses, elementary events or particles can be drawn from the analysis of\nthe model systems.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20ad"}
