{"prompt": "  We investigate the statistical distribution of the zeros of Dirichlet\n$L$--functions both analytically and numerically. Using the Hardy--Littlewood\nconjecture about the distribution of prime numbers we show that the two--point\ncorrelation function of these zeros coincides with that for eigenvalues of the\nGaussian unitary ensemble of random matrices, and that the distributions of\nzeros of different $L$--functions are statistically independent. Applications\nof these results to Epstein's zeta functions are shortly discussed.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20ch"}
{"prompt": "  We compute the spectral correlation functions for the transition from a\nharmonic oscillator towards the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). We use a\nvariant of the supersymmetry method to obtain analytical results in a fast and\nelegant way. In contrast to certain related transitions, the k-point\ncorrelation function possesses the k*k determinant structure of the GUE limit\nfor the entire transition. The results are used to consider also the spectral\ncorrelations of a superposition of M transition spectra. Our results are\nnon-perturbative and are valid for all values of the transition parameter.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20ch"}
