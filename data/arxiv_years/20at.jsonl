{"prompt": "  We present a semiempirical Gaunt factor for widely used Van Regemorter\nformula [Astrophys. J. 136, 906 (1962)] for the case of allowed transitions in\natoms with the LS coupling scheme.

{"prompt": "  A method for the experimental reconstruction of the quantum state of motion\nfor a single trapped ion is proposed. It is based on the measurement of the\nground state population of the trap after a sudden change of the trapping\npotential. In particular, we show how the Q function and the quadrature\ndistribution can be measured directly. In an example we demonstrate the\nprinciple and analyze the sensibility of the reconstruction process to\nexperimental uncertainties as well as to finite grid limitations. Our method is\nnot restricted to the Lamb-Dicke Limit and works in one or more dimensions.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20at"}
{"prompt": "  The Einstein - de Broglie particle-soliton concept is applied to simulate\nstationary states of an electron in a hydrogen atom. According to this concept,\nthe electron is described by the localized regular solutions to some nonlinear\nequations. In the framework of Synge model for interacting scalar and\nelectromagnetic fields a system of integral equations has been obtained, which\ndescribes the interaction between charged 3D soliton and Coulomb center. The\nasymptotic expressions for physical fields, describing soliton moving around\nthe fixed Coulomb center, have been obtained with the help of integral\nequations. It is shown that the electron-soliton center travels along some\nstationary orbit around the Coulomb center. The electromagnetic radiation is\nabsent as the Poynting vector has non-wave asymptote $O(r^{-3})$ after\naveraging over angles, i.e. the existence of spherical surface corresponding to\nnull Poynting vector stream, has been proved. Vector lines for Poynting vector\nare constructed in asymptotical area.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20at"}
{"prompt": "  A radial magnetic field can induce a time invariance violating electric\ndipole moment (EDM) in quantum systems. The EDMs of the Tl, Cs, Xe and Hg atoms\nand the neutron that are produced by such a field are estimated. The\ncontributions of such a field to the constants, $\\chi$ of the T,P-odd\ninteractions $\\chi_e {\\bf N} \\cdot {\\bf s}/s$ and $\\chi_N {\\bf N} \\cdot {\\bf\nI}/I$ are also estimated for the TlF, HgF and YbF molecules (where ${\\bf s}$\n(${\\bf I}$) is the electron (nuclear) spin and ${\\bf N}$ is the molecular\naxis). The best limit on the contact monopole field can be obtained from the\nmeasured value of the Tl EDM. The possibility of such a field being produced\nfrom polarization of the vacuum of electrically charged magnetic monopoles\n(dyons) by a Coulomb field is discussed, as well as the limit on these dyons.\nAn alternative mechanism involves chromomagnetic and chromoelectric fields in\nQCD.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20at"}
{"prompt": "  We consider a single Rydberg atom having two degenerate levels interacting\nwith the radiation field in a single-mode ideal cavity. The transition between\nthe levels is carried out by a $\\Lambda$-type degenerate two-photon process via\na third level far away from single-photon resonance. At the start of\ninteraction, the atom is considered to be in a coherent superposition of its\ntwo levels and the field in a coherent state. We study the dynamics of the\natomic as well as the field states. The squeezing in the quadratures of atomic\nstates can reach up to $100\\%$. The cavity field evolves to a statistical\nmixture of two coherent fields with the phase difference between them decided\nby the interaction time. Analysis of entropies of the atom and the field shows\nthat the two systems are dis-entangled periodically in certain cases.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20at"}
{"prompt": "  Nuclear processes can be stimulated by the presence of a macroscopic number\nof bosons in one of the final states. We describe the conditions necessary to\nobserve the atom-stimulation of a beta decay process. The stimulation may be\nobservable if it becomes possible to produce a Bose-Einstein condensate with\nthe order of $10^{14}$ atoms in a trap.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20at"}
{"prompt": "  Theories which have been used to describe the quantized electromagnetic field\ninteracting with a nonlinear dielectric medium are either phenomenological or\nderived by quantizing the macroscopic Maxwell equations. Here we take a\ndifferent approach and derive a Hamiltonian describing interacting fields from\none which contains both field and matter degrees of freedom. The medium is\nmodelled as a collection of two-level atoms, and these interact with the\nelectromagnetic field. The atoms are grouped into effective spins and the\nHolstein- Primakoff representation of the spin operators is used to expand them\nin one over the total spin. When the lowest-order term is combined with the\nfree atomic and field Hamiltonians, a theory of noninteracting polaritons\nresults. When higher-order terms are expressed in terms of polariton operators,\nstandard nonlinear optical interactions emerge.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20at"}
