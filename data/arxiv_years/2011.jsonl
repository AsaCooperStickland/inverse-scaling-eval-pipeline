We carry out the first exploration of what happens\nto the decoupled magnetic flux in 3D, using an MHD version of the ENZO adaptive\nmesh refinement code. The field-matter decoupling is achieved through a sink\nparticle treatment, which is needed to follow the protostellar accretion phase\nof star formation. We find that the accumulation of the decoupled flux near the\naccreting protostar leads to a magnetic pressure buildup. The high pressure is\nreleased anisotropically, along the path of least resistance. It drives a\nlow-density expanding region in which the decoupled magnetic flux is expelled.\nThis decoupling-enabled magnetic structure has never been seen before in 3D MHD\nsimulations of star formation. It generates a strong asymmetry in the\nprotostellar accretion flow, potentially giving a kick to the star.
