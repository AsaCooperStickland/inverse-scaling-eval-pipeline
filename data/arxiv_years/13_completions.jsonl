Conversly, the\neffect of length on the sense mode frequency is dominant. The resonance\nfrequencies, kinetic energy ratios, scale factors of gyroscope are compared to\nevaluate the mode quality. The results show that the kinetic energy in y-axis\ndirection of the drive mode and the kinetic energy in z-axis direction of the\nsense mode increase with the thickness of the PZT block, and consequently the\nscale factor of the gyroscope increases. For a constant thickness of the PZT\nblock the scale factor will decrease as the length increases.

We obtained\nultraviolet spectroscopic data from the Cosmic Origin Spectrograph (COS)\nprobing the CGM of 20 low-redshift foreground galaxies using background QSOs.\nOur sample consists of starburst and control galaxies. The latter comprises\nnormal star-forming and passive galaxies with similar stellar masses and impact\nparameters as the starbursts. We used optical spectra from the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey(SDSS) to estimate the properties of the starbursts, inferring\naverage ages of 200 Myrs and burst fractions involving ~10% of their stellar\nmass. The COS data reveal highly ionized gas traced by CIV in 80%(4/5) of the\nstarburst and in 17%(2/12) of the control sample. The two control galaxies with\nCIV absorbers differed from the four starbursts in showing multiple\nlow-ionization transitions and strong saturated Lyman-alpha lines. They\ntherefore appear to be physically different systems. We show that the CIV\nabsorbers in the starburst CGM represent a significant baryon repository. The\nhigh detection rate of this highly ionized material in the starbursts suggests\nthat starburst-driven winds can affect the CGM out to radii as large as 200\nkpc. This is plausible given the inferred properties of the starbursts and the\nknown properties of starburst-driven winds. This would represent the first\ndirect observational evidence of local starbursts impacting the bulk of their\ngaseous halos, and as such provides new evidence of the importance of this kind\nof feedback in the evolution of galaxies.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15"}

The crucial parameter determining\nthe ejecta mass is the radius R_1.35 of a 1.35 M_sun NS. NSs with smaller\nR_1.35 (\"soft\" EoS) eject systematically higher masses. These range from ~10^-3\nM_sun to ~10^-2 M_sun for 1.35-1.35 M_sun binaries and from ~5*10^-3 M_sun to\n~2*10^-2 M_sun for 1.2-1.5 M_sun systems (with kinetic energies between\n~5*10^49 erg and 10^51 erg).

If these signals with absolute bolometric\nmagnitudes from -15.0 to -16.7 are measured, the tight correlation of their\nproperties with those of the merging NSs might provide valuable constraints on\nthe high-density EoS.

{"prompt": "  The scaling exponent of a hierarchy of cities used to be regarded as a\nfractal parameter. The Pareto exponent was treated as the fractal dimension of\nsize distribution of cities, while the Zipf exponent was treated as the\nreciprocal of the fractal dimension. However, this viewpoint is not exact. In\nthis paper, I will present a new interpretation of the scaling exponent of\nrank-size distributions. The ideas from fractal measure relation and the\nprinciple of dimension consistency are employed to explore the essence of\nPareto's and Zipf's scaling exponents. The Pareto exponent proved to be a ratio\nof the fractal dimension of a network of cities to the average dimension of\ncity population. Accordingly, the Zipf exponent is the reciprocal of this\ndimension ratio. On a digital map, the Pareto exponent can be defined by the\nscaling relation between a map scale and the corresponding number of cities\nbased on this scale. The cities of the United States of America in 1900, 1940,\n1960, and 1980 and Indian cities in 1981, 1991, and 2001 are utilized to\nillustrate the geographical spatial meaning of Pareto's exponent.

The FGPB can be installed at the tip of each\nmain tether of an electric solar wind sail (E-sail) so that one can actively\nmanage the tethers to avoid their mutual collisions and to modify the spin rate\nof the sail if needed. This enables a more scalable and modular E-sail than the\nbaseline approach where auxiliary tethers are used for collision avoidance. For\npurely photonic sail applications one can remove the tethers and increase the\nsize of the blades to obtain a novel variant of the heliogyro that can have a\nsignificantly higher packing density than the traditional heliogyro. For\nsatellite deorbiting in low Earth orbit (LEO) conditions, analogous designs\nexist where the E-sail effect is replaced by the negative polarity plasma brake\neffect and the photonic pressure by atmospheric drag.

To fulfill the interference and delay\nconstraints simultaneously, we propose to perform adaptive zero-forcing\nbeamforming (ZFBF) at cognitive transmitters according to interference channel\nstate information (CSI). To assist the CAHNet to obtain the interference CSI,\nwe use a win-win inter-network cooperation strategy, namely quantized\ninterference CSI feedback from the primary network to CAHNet through a feedback\nlink, under the condition that the CAHNet pays a proper price for it.\nConsidering the scarcity of feedback and power resources, we focus on the\nminimization of the overall resource cost subject to both interference and\ndelay constraints. To solve the problem, we derive a joint feedback and power\ncontrol algorithm amongst multiple links of CAHNet.

It is considered to be a chaotic stationary\nflow field, with self-similar fractalline features. A number of approximate\nmodels exist, often exploiting this self-similarity. The idealized mathematical\nmodel of Fractal Potential Flows is hereby presented, and linked\nphilosophically to the phenomenon of FDT on a free surface, based on its\nexperimental characteristics. The model hinges on the recursive iteration of a\nfluid dynamical transfer operator. The existence of its unique attractor -\ncalled the invariant flow - is shown in an appropriate function space, which\nwill serve as our suggested model for the FDT flow field.

The DLAs and sub-DLAs are\nbelieved to contain a large fraction of neutral gas mass in the Universe. In\nPaper I of the series, we present the results of a search for DLAs and sub-DLAs\nin the ESO-UVES Advanced Data Products dataset of 250 quasars. Here we use an\nunbiased sub-sample of sub-DLAs from this dataset. We build a subset of 122\nquasars ranging from 1.5 <z_em < 5.0, suitable for statistical analysis. The\nstatistical sample is analyzed in conjunction with other sub-DLA samples from\nthe literature. This makes up a combined sample of 89 sub-DLAs over a redshift\npath of $\\Delta z=193$. Redshift evolution of the number density and the line\ndensity are derived for sub-DLAs and compared with the LLSs and DLAs\nmeasurements from the literature. The results indicate that these three classes\nof absorbers are evolving in the redshift interval 1 < z < 5. The column\ndensity distribution, f(N,z), down to the sub-DLA limit is determined. The\nflattening of f_(N,z) in the sub-DLA regime is present in the observations. The\nredshift evolution of f_(N,z) down to sub-DLA regime is also presented,\nindicating the presence of more sub-DLAs at high-redshift as compared to\nlow-redshift. f_(N,z) is further used to determine the neutral gas mass\ndensity, Omega_g, at 1.5 < z < 5.0.

It was previously\nbelieved that the surface of an ETI must be gapless unless one of these\nsymmetries is broken. A well-known symmetry-preserving, gapless surface\ntermination of an ETI supports an odd number of Dirac cones. In this paper we\ndeduce a symmetry-respecting, gapped surface termination of an ETI, which\ncarries an intrinsic 2d topological order, Moore-Read x anti-semion. The\nMoore-Read sector supports non-Abelian charge 1/4 anyons, while the Abelian,\nanti-semion sector is electrically neutral. Time-reversal symmetry is\nimplemented in this surface phase in a highly non-trivial way. Moreover, it is\nimpossible to realize this phase strictly in 2d, simultaneously preserving its\nimplementation of both the particle number and time-reversal symmetries. A 1d\nedge on the ETI surface between the topologically-ordered phase and the\ntopologically trivial time-reversal-broken phase with a Hall conductivity\nsigma_H = 1/2, carries a right-moving neutral Majorana mode, a right-moving\nbosonic charge mode and a left-moving bosonic neutral mode.

In\nprinciple, this allows for precise identification of the occupied subbands from\nthe magnetoconductance patterns of quasi-ballistic devices. The aperiodicity\nbecomes more apparent as the potential flattens. A quantitative method is\nintroduced for matching features in the conductance data to the subband\nstructure resulting from a particular radial potential, where a functional form\nfor the potential is used that depends on two free parameters. Finally, a\nshort-channel InAs nanowire FET device is measured at low temperature in search\nof conductance features that reveal the subband structure. Features are\nidentified and shown to be consistent with three specific subbands. The\nexperiment is analyzed in the context of the weak localization regime, however,\nwe find that the subband effects predicted for ballistic transport should\nremain visible when back scattering dominates over interband scattering, as is\nexpected for this device.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 14"}
