It is shown that GCR reacceleration and CR\nspallation produce a measurable effect at high energies, especially in the\nsecondary to primary (s/p) ratio, making its energy-dependence substantially\nflatter than predicted by the standard model. Quantitatively, the effect\ndepends strongly upon the density of the surrounding circumstellar matter. GCR\nreacceleration dominates secondary CR production for a low circumstellar\ndensity. It increases the expected s/p ratio substantially and flattens its\nspectrum to an almost energy-independent form for energies larger than 100\nGeV/n if the supernovae explode on average into a hot dilute medium with\nhydrogen number density $N_H=0.003$cm$^{-3}$.

{"prompt": "  We show empirically that fits to the color-magnitude relation of Type Ia\nsupernovae after optical maximum can provide accurate relative extragalactic\ndistances.

These linear relations can provide\nrobust distance estimates, in particular, by using the magnitudes when the\nsupernova reaches a given color. After correction for light curve strech factor\nor decline rate, the dispersion of the magnitudes taken at the intercept of the\nlinear color-magnitude relation are found to be around 0$^m$.08 for the\nsub-sample of supernovae with \\BVm $\\le 0^m.05$, and around 0$^m$.11 for the\nsub-sample with \\BVm $\\le 0^m.2$.

Six\nyears of observations (from 1996 to 2002) have amounted to 7 Ms of Galactic\ncenter observations and the detection of 1823 bursts. The 3 most frequent\nbursters are GX 354-0 (423 bursts), KS 1731-260 (339) and GS 1826-24 (260).\nThese numbers reflect an unique dataset. We show that all sources have the same\nglobal burst behavior as a function of luminosity. At the lowest luminosities\n(L_X<=2E37 erg/s bursts occur quasi-periodically and the burst rate increases\nlinearly with accretion rate (clear in e.g. GS 1826-24 and KS 1731-260). At\nL_pers=2E37 erg/s the burst rate drops by a factor of five. This corresponds to\nthe transition from, on average, a hydrogen-rich to a pure helium environment\nin which the flashes originate that are responsible for the bursts. At higher\nluminosities the bursts recur irregularly; no bursts are observed at the\nhighest luminosities. Our central finding is that most of the trends in\nbursting behavior are driven by the onset of stable hydrogen burning in the\nneutron star atmosphere. Furthermore, we notice three new observational fact\nwhich are difficult to explain with current burst theory: the presence of short\npure-helium bursts at the lowest accretion regimes, the bimodal distribution of\npeak burst rates, and an accretion rate that is ten times higher than predicted\nat which the onset of stable hydrogen burning occurs.

At high energies, the five-dimensional effective\ntheory is assumed to have a scale invariance so that it admits an expanding\nscaling solution as a future attractor. The system automatically approaches the\nscaling solution and, hence, the initial condition for the subsequent\nlow-energy brane cosmology is set by the scaling solution. At low energies, the\nscale invariance is broken and a radion stabilization mechanism drives the\ndynamics of the brane-world system.

At a given optical luminosity, there is no systematic difference in\noxygen abundance between the sample of Virgo dIs and the sample of nearby dIs.\nHowever, five of the eleven Virgo dIs exhibit much lower baryonic gas fractions\nthan field dIs at comparable oxygen abundances. Using field dIs as a reference,\na gas-deficiency index for dIs is constructed, making it possible\nquantitatively to identify which galaxies have lost gas. For the Virgo sample,\nsome of the dwarfs are gas-deficient by a factor of 30.

The ellipticity correlation\nfunction of the residuals is studied to quantify the effect of imperfect\ncorrections for PSF anisotropy on cosmic shear studies. These imperfections\noccur on the chip scale and consequently the systematic signal decreases\nrapidly with increasing angular scale. Separation of the signal into ``E''\n(curl-free) and ``B'' (curl) components can help to identify the presence of\nresidual systematics, but in general, the amplitude of the ``B''-mode is\ndifferent from that of the ``E''-mode.

In the presence of the induced SDW, we\nfind that there exists no simple direct relationship between NMR signal rate\nT_1^{-1} and low energy local density of states while these two quantities are\nlinearly proportional to each other in a pure DSC. In the vortex core region,\nT_1^{-1} on ^{17}O site may exhibit a double-peak behavior, one sharp and one\nbroad, as the temperature is increased to the superconductivity transition\ntemperature T_c, in contrast to a single broad peak for a pure DSC. The\nexistence of the sharp peak corresponds to the disappearance of the induced SDW\nabove a certain temperature T_{AF} which is assumed to be considerably lower\nthan T_c. We also show the differences between T_1^{-1} on ^{17}O and that on\n^{63}Cu as a function of lattice site at different temperatures and magnetic\nfields. Our results obtained from the scenario of the vortex with induced SDW\nis consistent with recent NMR and scanning tunneling microscopy experiments.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 03\n"}

We\nconsider Kolmogorov scaling as the most realistic and predict a reasonable\npp-neutrino emission around 100 GeV at the end of the radiative stage of the\nfireball expansion, for a large number of GRBs pending on their baryonic load.\nA second p$\\gamma$-neutrino emission is expected with the acceleration of\nprotons in the radiation free stage, but with a synchrotron loss limitation\nimmediately followed by a severe expansion loss limitation. According to the\nKolmogorov scaling, the protons could not reach the UHE-range. Anyway the large\npossibility of a two component neutrino emission would be an interesting clue\nof cosmic ray physics.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 03\n"}

In terms of\nrelativity, however, the state of rest cannot be reasonably defined for luxons\nand tachyons, and, therefore, today it does not make sense to speak of rest\nmass of such objects. It is shown here that the phrases \"negative squared\nmass\", \"imaginary mass\", and \"photon's zero mass\" result from applying\nbradyonic dynamical relativistic relations to determine properties of luxons\nand tachyons; and that this erroneous procedure results from an unfortunate\ninterpretation of kinematical relativistic relations.

Using a sample of 8 Galactic\nopen clusters and the GC 47 Tuc, we determine the cluster distances, and hence\nthe RC absolute magnitude in V, I and K, by applying our empirical main\nsequence fitting method, which utilizes a large sample of local field dwarfs\nwith accurate HIPPARCOS parallaxes.

{"prompt": "  Using the bright galaxy counts from the 2 Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS)\nsecond incremental release, two techniques for probing large-scale structure at\ndistances of ~150 h-1 Mpc are investigated. First, we study the counts from two\nsets of six 5 degree by ~80 degree strips in the two galactic caps. In the six\nsouthern strips a deficit of ~30% was found relative to a predicted homogeneous\ndistribution at K~11. These strips were also in good agreement with a model\nincorporating the radial density function of the southern 2dF Galaxy Redshift\nSurvey (2dFGRS), which shows a deep underdensity between ~90 and 180 h-1 mpc.\nThese results indicate a very large `local hole' in the Southern Galactic Cap\n(SGC) to >150 h-1 Mpc with a linear size across the sky of ~200 h-1 Mpc, but\nwith a significantly lower mean underdensity of ~30% than that suggested by the\nbright APM SGC counts. The counts in the northern set of strips are low overall\nbut indicate a more varied pattern. When all the available 2MASS data with\n|b|>30 were aggregated, they indicated underdensities of ~18% and ~30% at K~11\nfor the northern and southern areas respectively. Our second method uses the\nratio of the counts with 11.38<K<12.38 to 12.88<K<13.38 binned in 25 degree\nsquared areas; the counts from these areas provide a smoothed map over the sky\nof the slope in the counts between K=11.38 and 13.38. The resulting map picks\nout known rich clusters, demonstrating usefulness as a probe of LSS at\ndistances of <150 h-1 Mpc. Interestingly, the map also shows large regions,\n\\~100 degrees across, of steep counts in both hemispheres. Thus, the present\n2MASS data suggest the presence of a potentially huge contiguous void\nstretching from south to north, indicating the possible presence of significant\npower on scales of >300 h-1 Mpc in the galaxy power spectrum.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 03\n"}

As the parton energy density is much higher at\nlead-lead collisions than in pp collisions at LHC, one natural question is\nwhether the produced black holes will be able to absorb the partons formed in\nthe lead-lead collisions and eventually `eat' the quark-gluon plasma formed at\nLHC. In this paper, we make a quantitative analysis of this possibility and\nfind that since the energy density of partons formed in lead-lead collisions at\nLHC is about 500 GeV/fm^3, the rate of absorption for one of these black holes\nis much smaller than the rate of evaporation.

{"prompt": "  A simple antiferromagnetic approach to the Mott transition was recently shown\nto provide a satisfactory explanation for the Mott gap collapse with doping\nobserved in photoemission experiments on electron-doped cuprates. Here this\napproach is extended in a number of ways. RPA, mode coupling (via\nself-consistent renormalization), and (to a limited extent) self-consistent\nBorn approximation calculations are compared to assess the roles of hot-spot\nfluctuations and interaction with spin waves. When fluctuations are included,\nthe calculation satisfies the Mermin-Wagner theorem, and the mean-field gap and\ntransition temperature are replaced by pseudogap and onset temperature. The\nmodel is in excellent agreement with experiments on the doping dependence of\nboth photoemission dispersion and magnetic properties. The magnetic phase\nterminates in a quantum critical point (QCP), with a natural phase boundary for\nthis QCP arising from hot-spot physics.\n  Since the resulting T=0 antiferromagnetic transition is controlled by a\ngeneralized Stoner factor, an ansatz is made of dividing the Stoner factor up\ninto a material-dependent part, the bare susceptibility and a\ncorrelation-dependent part, the Hubbard U, which depends only weakly on doping.\n  From the material dependent part of the interaction, it is possible to\nexplain the striking differences between electron- and hole-doping, despite an\napproximate symmetry in the doping of the QCP.

The galaxy is very compact (marginally resolved with ACS\nwith a half-light radius of 0.08arcsec, so r_hl<0.5kpc/h_70). We have obtained\na deep (5.5-hour) spectrum of this z'(AB)=24.7 galaxy with the DEIMOS optical\nspectrograph on Keck, and here we report the discovery of a single emission\nline centred on 8245Ang detected at 20sigma with a flux of f~2E-17 ergs/s/cm^2.\nThe line is clearly resolved with detectable structure at our resolution of\nbetter than 55km/s, and the only plausible interpretation consistent with the\nACS photometry is that we are seeing Lyman-alpha emission from a z=5.78 galaxy.\nThis is the highest redshift galaxy to be discovered and studied using HST\ndata. The velocity width Delta(v)_FWHM=260km/s and rest-frame equivalent width\n(W=20Ang) indicate that this line is most probably powered by star formation,\nas an AGN would typically have larger values.

The language features\nallow for structure in the metadata by including full expressions, namespaces,\nfunctional dependencies, site specific parameters in a grid environment, and\nontological definitions. It also has simple control structures for\nparallelization of large jobs. McRunjob features a modular design which allows\nfor easy expansion to new job description languages or new application level\ntasks.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 03\n"}

In this paper we (re-)consider the Cepheid star population of\nNGC1866, to try to shed some light on this discrepancy. By combining various\nextensive photometric datasets in BVI and single-epoch 2MASS JHK photometry, PL\nrelationships for the cluster Cepheids are obtained. A comparison between the\nfield LMC and cluster PL relationships for the reddening free Wesenheit index\ngives a firm determination of the distance between the cluster and the LMC main\nbody (0.04 mag in distance modulus, the cluster being more distant) which,\ncoupled to a model for the geometry of the LMC disk, provides \\Delta (DM)\nranging between 0.0 and -0.11 mag.

Below a critical value of the accretion rate all systems are\nassumed to undergo a transition to a state where the dominant accretion mode is\noptically thin and radiatively inefficient. In these significantly\nsub-Eddington systems, the spectral energy distribution is predicted to be\ndominated by non-thermal emission from a relativistic jet whereas\nnear-Eddington black holes will be dominated instead by emission from the\naccretion disk. Reasonable candidates for such a sub-Eddington state include\nX-ray binaries in the hard and quiescent states, the Galactic Center (Sgr A*),\nLINERs, FR I radio galaxies, and a large fraction of BL Lac objects. Standard\njet physics predicts non-linear scaling between the optically thick (radio) and\noptically thin (optical or X-ray) emission of these systems, which has been\nconfirmed recently in X-ray binaries. We show that this scaling relation is\nalso a function of black hole mass and only slightly of the relativistic\nDoppler factor.

A triaxial, \"bar shaped\" compact\nstar could be an efficient source of continuous wave gravitational radiation in\nthe frequency range of the forthcoming interferometric detectors. We locate the\nsecular instability point along several constant baryon mass sequences of\nuniformly rotating strange stars described by the MIT bag model. Contrary to\nneutron stars, strange stars with T/|W| (the ratio of the rotational kinetic\nenergy to the absolute value of the gravitational potential energy) much lower\nthan the corresponding value for the mass-shed limit can be secularly unstable\nto bar mode formation if shear viscosity is high enough to damp out any\ndeviation from uniform rotation. The instability develops for a broad range of\ngravitational masses and rotational frequencies of strange quark stars. It\nimposes strong constraints on the lower limit of the frequency at the innermost\nstable circular orbit around rapidly rotating strange stars. The above results\nare robust for all linear self-bound equations of state assuming the growth\ntime of the instability is faster than the damping timescale. We discuss\nastrophysical scenarios where triaxial instabilities (r-mode and viscosity\ndriven instability) could be relevant in strange stars described by the\nstandard MIT bag model of normal quark matter.

{"prompt": "  In this paper we derive a bound on the rate of change of the gravitational\nconstant G coming from the pulsating white dwarf G117-B15A. This star is a ZZ\nCeti pulsator extensively studied with astroseismological techniques for last\nthree decades. The most recent determination of {\\dot P} = (2.3 \\pm 1.4) *\n10^{-15} s/s^{-1} for the 215.2s fundamental mode agrees very well with\npredictions of the best fit theoretical model. The rate of change of the\noscillation period can be explained by two effects: the cooling (dominant\nfactor) and change of gravitational binding energy (residual gravitational\ncontraction). Since the white dwarfs are pulsating in g-modes whose frequencies\nare related to the Brunt-Vaisala frequency (explicitly dependent on G)\nobservational determination of the change of the period (more precisely the\ndifference between observed and calculated \\dot P) can be used to set the upper\nbound on the rate of change of G.
