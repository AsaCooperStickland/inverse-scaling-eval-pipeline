{"prompt": "  Search engines perform the task of retrieving information related to the\nuser-supplied query words. This task has two parts; one is finding \"featured\nwords\" which describe an article best and the other is finding a match among\nthese words to user-defined search terms. There are two main independent\napproaches to achieve this task. The first one, using the concepts of\nsemantics, has been implemented partially. For more details see another paper\nof Marko et al., 2002. The second approach is reported in this paper. It is a\ntheoretical model based on using Neural Network (NN). Instead of using keywords\nor reading from the first few lines from papers/articles, the present model\ngives emphasis on extracting \"featured words\" from an article. Obviously we\npropose to exclude prepositions, articles and so on, that is, English words\nlike \"of, the, are, so, therefore, \" etc. from such a list. A neural model is\ntaken with its nodes pre-assigned energies. Whenever a match is found with\nfeatured words and userdefined search words, the node is fired and jumps to a\nhigher energy. This firing continues until the model attains a steady energy\nlevel and total energy is now calculated. Clearly, higher match will generate\nhigher energy; so on the basis of total energy, a ranking is done to the\narticle indicating degree of relevance to the user's interest. Another\nimportant feature of the proposed model is incorporating a semantic module to\nrefine the search words; like finding association among search words, etc. In\nthis manner, information retrieval can be improved markedly.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 02\n"}

The presence of\nseveral sources with different Gamma_jet will lead to superposition of several\nsuch peaks. Additionally, diffusive particle acceleration should produce a\npowerlaw whose low energy cutoff at or above Gamma_jet^2 m c^2 would be visible\nas another spectral feature.

We provide estimates of the\neffects of adiabatic losses, which pose the greatest challenge to models of\nnarrow band CR production in microquasar jets. While the total energy contained\nin the microquasar CR component is highly uncertain, the CR spectrum in the\nvicinity of microquasars would be severely affected.

{"prompt": "  We study the radial migration of dust particles in accreting protostellar\ndisks analogous to the primordial solar nebula. This study takes account of the\ntwo dimensional (radial and normal) structure of the disk gas, including the\neffects of the variation in the gas velocity as a function of distance from the\nmidplane. It is shown that the dust component of disks accretes slower than the\ngas component. At high altitude from the disk midplane, the gas rotates faster\nthan particles because of the inward pressure gradient force, and its drag\nforce causes particles to move outward in the radial direction. Viscous torque\ninduces the gas within a scale height from the disk midplane to flow outward,\ncarrying small (size < 100 micron at 10 AU) particles with it. Only particles\nat intermediate altitude or with sufficiently large sizes (> 1 mm at 10 AU)\nmove inward. When the particles' radial velocities are averaged over the entire\nvertical direction, particles have a net inward flux. At large distances from\nthe central star, particles migrate inward with a velocity much faster than the\ngas accretion velocity. However, their inward velocity is reduced below that of\nthe gas in the inner regions of the disk. The rate of velocity decrease is a\nfunction of the particles' size. While larger particles retain fast accretion\nvelocity until they approach closer to the star, 10 micron particles have\nslower velocity than the gas in the most part of the disk (r < 100 AU). This\ndifferential migration of particles causes the size fractionation. Dust disks\ncomposed mostly of small particles (size < 10 micron) accrete slower than gas\ndisks, resulting in the increase in the dust-gas ratio during the gas accretion\nphase.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 02\n"}

On the other hand, the low\ntemperature Drude weight of spin gap systems shows an activated behavior\nmodulated by a power law. For temperatures higher than the spin gap, one\nrecovers the linear T behavior akin to gapless systems. For temperatures larger\nthan the exchange coupling, the Drude weight decays as 1/T^2.

According to the accepted knowledge, the sound itself is\ncreated by strong electric fields on the ground induced by the meteor.\nNonetheless, there is no convincing theory that can fully explain how a meteor\ncan generate such a strong electric field. Extreme rareness of the phenomenon\nhas prevented a substantial experimental work so far; thus, consequently, it\nremains on the margins of scientific interest. This is quite unfortunate since\nthese electric fields suggest existence of a highly complex electromagnetic\ncoupling and charge dynamics between the meteors and the ionosphere. Therefore,\nthe existing theoretical work relies mostly on the witness reports. The Global\nElectrophonic Fireball Survey (GEFS) is the first systematic survey of witness\nreports of these sounds with a standardized questionnaire designed exclusively\nfor this phenomenon. Here we present the overall picture of the phenomenon that\nemerged after almost 100 reports collected by GEFS. It becomes clear now that\nthe lover meteor brightness limit is about -2$^m$, suggesting a bias in the\nexisting electrophonic sounds catalogues toward brighter meteors. In contrast\nto the current belief that such low brightness electrophonic meteors produce\ntransient sounds, we find that they can also produce sustained sounds. The\ncurrent theories can not accommodate these results.

Second, we find that the increase of CPU\ntime with the particle multiplicity is much faster for the Durham jet\nclustering algorithm in comparison with Deterministic Annealing.

Second we dwell on the concept that merging galaxies naturally\nlead to merging Black Holes. Here we emphasize two aspects: a) the torque\nexerted by the binary Black Holes carves a torus like distribution out of the\nstellar population near to the Black Hole binary; b) We consider the last\nstages of the Black Hole binary merger, taking into account the angle between\nthe spin of the primary Black Hole, and the orbital spin of the second Black\nHole. We show that the loss of orbital angular momentum is very strongly\nspin-dependent; for large angles between the two spins the angular momentum\nloss is strongly inhibited, allowing spin flip of the primary Black Hole which\npreserves a high angular momentum relative to the maximum allowed. This ensures\nthat both before and after the merger the accretion disk may reach to very\nsmall distances from the central Black Hole, with very high local temperatures\nright near the base of the jet: This is especially interesting in the case that\nforming the jet requires the formation of an ADAF like ring near the inner edge\nof the disk, as suggested by some earlier work.

{"prompt": "  We investigate whether Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) from the Current BATSE Catalog\nhave been affected by weak lensing by the nearby large scale structure. The\nredshift distribution of GRBs is believed to be broad, extending to z~5, so\nmost events can be assumed to be at large redshifts, and hence subject to weak\nlensing, which would betray itself as projected (anti-)correlations between GRB\nevents and galaxies or clusters that trace the intervening mass. Given the\nobserved distribution of GRBs in fluence, and statistical positional error, e,\nwe predict that most subsets drawn from BATSE Catalog will be anti-correlated\nwith the foreground structure due to weak lensing, i.e. will show negative\nmagnification bias. We find that GRBs are indeed anti-correlated with the APM\ngalaxies (z~0.2-0.3) in the sense that galaxy density in circles of radii 1-1.5\ndeg (15-20 Mpc at z~0.3) centered on e<1 GRBs is about 10% lower than expected\nfrom a random distribution; the significance of GRB-APM anti-correlations\nreaches 99.7%. Cross-correlation between GRBs and distant rich\nAbell-Corwin-Olowin clusters is also negative. Standard cosmological models\nwith Omega_matter ~ 0.3, Omega_Lambda ~ 0.7, and matter distribution on large\nscales following observed APM galaxy distribution with the biasing parameter of\naround 1 are not able to reproduce our GRB-APM anti-correlations. We propose a\nspeculative model that does account for these anti-correlations as well as\npositive correlations found previously, between QSOs and APM galaxies.

A short\ncalculation then shows that such mirrors necessarily absorb enough heat from\nthe thermal bath that their increased mass prevents them from floating on the\nthermal radiation.

We confirm the weak trend of\nincreasing gas richness with decreasing luminosity found by previous authors.\nGas richness is also shown to be weakly anti-correlated with metallicity. The\ndependence of star formation rates (SFRs) and HI gas depletion timescales on\nmetallicity is examined. The median solar metallicity based SFR and gas\ndepletion timescale are 0.1639 M_sun/yr and 5 Gyrs, respectively.

{"prompt": "  The present paper is the companion of [1] in which we proposed a scheme that\ntries to derive the Quantum Field Theory (QFT) on Curved Spacetimes (CST) limit\nfrom background independent Quantum General Relativity (QGR).

In the\npresent paper, we employ the complexifier coherent states for QGR recently\nproposed by Thiemann and Winkler as semiclassical states, and thus fill the\ngeneral formulas obtained in [1] with life. We demonstrate how one can, under\nsome simplifying assumptions, explicitely compute expectation values of the\noperators relevant for the gravity-matter Hamiltonians of [1] in the\ncomplexifier coherent states. These expectation values give rise to effective\nmatter Hamiltonians on the background on which the gravitational coherent state\nis peaked and thus induce approximate notions of n-particle states and matter\npropagation on fluctuating spacetimes. We display the details for the scalar\nand the electromagnetic field. The effective theories exhibit two types of\ncorrections as compared to the the ordinary QFT on CST. The first is due to the\nquantum fluctuations of the gravitational field, the second arises from the\nfact that background independence forces both geometry and matter to propagate\non a spacetime that is the product of the real line and a (random) graph.\nFinally we obtain explicit numerical predictions for non-standard dispersion\nrelations for the scalar and the electromagnetic field.

{"prompt": "  The optically variable source SDSS J124602.54+011318.8 first appears in Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) data as a bright point source with nonstellar colors.\nSubsequent SDSS imaging and spectroscopy showed that the point source declined\nor disappeared, revealing an underlying host galaxy at redshift 0.385. Based on\nthese properties, the source was suggested to be a candidate ``orphan\nafterglow'': a moderately beamed optical transient, associated with a gamma-ray\nburst (GRB) whose highly beamed radiation cone does not include our line of\nsight. We present new imaging and spectroscopic observations of this source.\nWhen combined with a careful re-analysis of archival optical and radio data,\nthe observations prove that SDSS J124602.54+011318.8 is in fact an unusual\nradio-loud AGN, probably in the BL Lac class. The object displays strong\nphotometric variability on time scales of weeks to years, including several\nbright flares, similar to the one initially reported. The SDSS observations are\ntherefore almost certainly not related to a GRB. The optical spectrum of this\nobject dramatically changes in correlation with its optical brightness. At the\nbright phase, weak, narrow oxygen emission lines and probably a broader\nH$\\alpha$ line are superposed on a blue continuum.

{"prompt": "  We present a first step toward a microscopic theory for the glass transition\nin systems with trivial static correlations. As an example we have chosen N\ninfinitely thin hard rods with length L, fixed with their centers on a periodic\nlattice with lattice constant a. Starting from the N-rod Smoluchowski equation\nwe derive a coupled set of equations for fluctuations of reduced k-rod\ndensities. We approximate the influence of the surrounding rods onto the\ndynamics of a pair of rods by introduction of an effective rotational diffusion\ntensor D and in this way we obtain a self-consistent equation for D. This\nequation exhibits a feedback mechanism leading to a slowing down of the\nrelaxation. It involves as an input the Laplace transform v_0(l/r) at z=0,\nl=L/a, of a torque-torque correlator of an isolated pair of rods with distance\nR=ar. Our equation predicts the existence of a continuous ergodicity-breaking\ntransition at a critical length l_c=L_c/a. To estimate the critical length we\nperform an approximate analytical calculation of v_0(l/r) based on a\nvariational approach and obtain l_c^{var}=5.68, 4.84 and 3.96 for an sc, bcc\nand fcc lattice. We also evaluate v_0(l/r) numerically exactly from a two-rod\nsimulation. The latter calculation leads to l_c^{num}=3.45, 2.78 and 2.20 for\nthe corresponding lattices. Close to l_c the rotational diffusion constant\ndecreases as D(l) ~ (l_c - l)^\\gamma with \\gamma=1 and a diverging time scale\nt_\\epsilon ~ |l_c - l|^{-\\delta}, \\delta=2, appears. On this time scale the t-\nand l-dependence of the 1-rod density is determined by a master function\ndepending only on t/t_\\epsilon.

{"prompt": "  Many spiral galaxies show a large-scale asymmetry with a cos\\phi dependence\nin their rotation curves as well as in their morphology, such as M101 and NGC\n628. We show that both these features can be explained by the response of a\ngalactic disk to an imposed lopsided halo potential. A perturbation potential\nof 5 % is deduced for the morphologically lopsided galaxies in the Rix &\nZaritsky (1995) sample. This is shown to result in a difference of 10 % or\nabout 20-30 kms^{-1} in the rotation velocity on the two sides of the major\naxis. Interestingly, the observed isophotal asymmetry in a typical spiral\ngalaxy is not much smaller and it results in a velocity asymmetry of 7 % or\nabout 14-21 kms^{-1} . Hence, we predict that most galaxies show a fairly\nsignificant rotational asymmetry. The rotation velocity is shown to be maximum\nalong the elongated isophote - in agreement with the observations along the SW\nin M101, while it is minimum along the opposite direction. This result leads to\nthe distinctive asymmetric shape of the rotation curve which rises more steeply\nin one half of the galaxy than the other, as observed by Swaters et al.

It has been long believed that the orbit suffers circularization\ndue to the dynamical friction from the galactic halo during orbital decay. This\ncircularization was confirmed by numerous simulations where dynamical friction\nis added as external force. However, some of the resent N-body simulations\ndemonstrated that circularization is much slower than expected from approximate\ncalculations. We found that the dominant reason for this discrepancy is the\nassumption that Coulomb logarithm log Lambda is constant, which has been used\nin practically all recent calculations. Since the size of the satellite is\nrelatively large, accurate determination of the outer cutoff radius is crucial\nto obtain good estimate for the dynamical friction. An excellent agreement\nbetween $N$-body simulations and approximate calculations was observed when the\nouter cutoff radius is taken to be the distance of the satellite to the center\nof the galaxy. When satellite is at the perigalacticon, the distance to the\ncenter is smaller and therefore log Lambda becomes smaller.

A unified description of both\nprobabilities and phases comes through a generalisation of the notion of a\ndensity matrix for histories; this object is the decoherence functional of the\nconsistent histories approach. If we take phases as well as probabilities as\nprimitive elements of our theory, we abandon Kolmogorov probability and can\ndescribe quantum theory in terms of fundamental commutative observables,\nwithout being obstructed by Bell's and related theorems. Generalising the\ntheory of stochastic processes, we develop the description of relative phases\nand probabilities for paths on the classical phase space. This description\nprovides a theory of quantum processes. We identify a number of basic\npostulates and study its corresponding properties. We strongly emphasise the\nnotion of conditioning and are able to write ``quantum differential equations''\nas analogous to stochastic differential equations.

In\nPaper I and Paper II, we investigated the effects of dust absorption; here we\nextend our modelling in order to include the effects of scattering. We describe\nhow kinematical information can be combined with the radiative transfer\nequation, and present a Monte Carlo code that can handle kinematical\ninformation in an elegant way.\n  Compared to the case where only absorption is taken into account, we find\nthat dust attenuation considerably affects the observed kinematics when\nscattering is included. For the central lines of sight, dust can either\ndecrease or increase the central observed velocity dispersion. The most\nimportant effect of dust attenuation, however, is found at large projected\nradii. The kinematics at these lines of sight are strongly affected by photons\nscattered into these lines of sight, which were emitted by high-velocity stars\nin the central regions of the galaxy. These photons bias the LOSVDs towards\nhigh line-of-sight velocities, and significantly increase the observed velocity\ndispersion and LOSVD shape parameters. These effects are similar to the\nexpected kinematical signature of a dark matter halo, such that dust\nattenuation may form an alternative explanation for the usual stellar\nkinematical evidence for dark matter halos around elliptical galaxies.\n  We apply our results to discuss several other topics in galactic dynamics,\nwhere we feel dust attenuation should be taken into account.

We apply the code to several\nsimple cases of a uniform cloud to show how the Lya image and emitted line\nspectrum are affected by the column density, internal velocity gradients, and\nemissivity distribution. We then apply the code to two models for damped Lya\nabsorption systems: a spherical, static, isothermal cloud, and a flattened,\naxially symmetric, rotating cloud. If the emission is due to fluorescence of\nthe external background radiation, the Lya image should have a core\ncorresponding to the region where hydrogen is self-shielded. The emission line\nprofile has the characteristic double peak with a deep central trough. We show\nhow rotation of the cloud causes the two peaks to shift in wavelength as the\nslit is perpendicular to the rotation axis, and how the relative amplitude of\nthe two peaks is changed.

In addition to\nbeing spatially non-uniform, the CMB is theorized to be slightly polarized.\nMeasurements of this polarization, particularly at large angular scales, have\nthe potential to provide information on primordial gravitational waves,\ntheories of inflation, and the ionization history of the universe, as well as\nhelp further constrain cosmological parameters.\n  Polarization has not yet been detected in the CMB.

Motivated by the observed ``break'' in\nthe L_x-T_x relation at kT~1-2keV, our feedback model is based on the\nassumption that supernovae imprint a temperature scale on the hot gas, with the\nstar formation rate and corresponding reheated gas mass then depending only on\nthe available energy budget. We demonstrate that a strong feedback model with a\nheating temperature comparable to this break (kT_=2keV), and an energy budget\ntwice that available from supernovae (epsilon=2), raises the core entropy of\ngroups sufficiently to produce an adequate match to their observed X-ray\nproperties. A lower value of epsilon increases the star formation rate without\nsignificantly affecting the X-ray properties of groups, and a model with\nepsilon~0.1 reproduces the observed fraction of baryons in stars. However, a\nheating temperature which is lower than the virial temperatures of the groups\nleads to an excess of cooling gas that boosts their X-ray luminosities, due to\nthe failure of the reheated material to escape from the gravitational\npotential. A limited study of numerical resolution effects reveals that the\ntemperature of poorly-resolved objects is underestimated, therefore (in our\ncase) a fully-resolved group population would lead to a steeper L_x-T_x\nrelation, bringing our results into even better agreement with the\nobservations.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 02\n"}

Rev. A {\\bf 52}, 297 (1995)]. Owing to the recursion\nrelations which the generalized Fresnel coefficients satisfy, this result can\nbe applied to more complex systems with planar symmetry. This is illustrated by\ncalculating the Casimir force on a dielectric (metallic) slab in a planar\ncavity with realistic mirrors. Also, a relationship between the Casimir force\nand energy in two different layers is established.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 02\n"}

Almost all of the intergalactic OVI is associated with strong\nLy-a absorption (N_HI > 10^15.2 cm^-2), as well as absorption from CIV and\noften lower ionization species. The absorbing regions are conservatively\nconstrained to have L<=200 kpc and rho/rho_bar >= 2.5, with actual values\nprobably closer to L ~ 60 kpc and rho/rho_bar ~ 10-30. They also have two\ndistinct gas phases: one which produces photoionized CIV and SiIV at T ~ 30,000\nK, and a second which is seen only in OVI. The OVI temperature is difficult to\nconstrain due to uncertainty in the amount of nonthermal line broadening, but\nit does appear that this gas is hotter than the CIV/SiIV phase and could\nsupport collisional OVI production. The OVI is strongly clustered on velocity\nscales of dv=100-300 km/s, with weaker signal extending to dv = 750 km/s. The\npower-law slope of the correlation function resembles that of local galaxy and\ncluster surveys, with a comoving correlation length of 11h_{65}^-1 Mpc.

The\nradial velocity of the centre of the H_alpha emission is identical to that of\nthe companion star (at least for Hen 121 where this can be checked from the\navailable orbital elements), thus suggesting that the H_alpha emission\noriginates from gas moving with the companion star.

When\nexcited states are studied in the random-phase approximation (RPA), the same\nEFT scheme dictates the inclusion of both familiar particle-hole pairs and\ncontributions that mix valence and negative-energy single-particle Dirac wave\nfunctions. The modern EFT strategy therefore justifies and explains the\nomission of some explicit contributions from the negative-energy Dirac sea of\nnucleons, as was done to maintain conservation laws in earlier pragmatic\ncalculations of the nuclear linear response.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 02\n"}

The star-formation time in this Turbulent Core\nmodel for massive star formation is several mean free-fall timesscales of the\ncore, but is about equal to that of the region in which the core is embedded.\nThe typical time for a massive star to form is about 10^5 yr and the accretion\nrate is high enough to overcome radiation pressure due to the luminosity of the\nstar. For the typical case we consider, in which the cores out of which the\nstars form have a density structure varying as r^{-1.5}, the protostellar\naccretion rate grows linearly with time. We calculate the evolution of the\nradius of a protostar and determine the accretion luminosity. At the high\naccretion rates that are typical in regions of massive star formation,\nprotostars join the main sequence at about 20 solar masses. We apply these\nresults to predict the properties of protostars thought to be powering several\nobserved hot molecular cores, including the Orion hot core and W3(H2O). In the\nAppendixes, we discuss the pressure in molecular clouds and we argue that\n``logatropic'' models for molecular clouds are incompatible with observation.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 02\n"}

In the finite\ndimensional case, these two Hopf algebras share the same finite dimension. We\nshow that any Galois extension of a field is a torsor and that any torsor is a\nHopf-Galois extension. We give also examples of non-commutative torsors without\ncharacter. Torsors can be composed. This leads us to define a new\ngroup-invariant, its torsors invariant.
