{"prompt": "  In association with the Blanford-Znajek mechanism for rotational energy\nextraction from Kerr black holes, it is of some interest to explore how much of\nmagnetic flux can actually penetrate the horizon at least in idealized\nsituations. For completely uncharged Kerr hole case, it has been known for some\ntime that the magnetic flux gets entirely expelled when the hole is\nmaximally-rotating. In the mean time, it is known that when the rotating hole\nis immersed in an originally uniform magnetic field surrounded by an ionized\ninterstellar medium (plasma), which is a more realistic situation, the hole\naccretes certain amount of electric charge. In the present work, it is\ndemonstrated that as a result of this accretion charge small enough not to\ndisturb the geometry, the magnetic flux through this slightly charged Kerr hole\ndepends not only on the hole's angular momentum but on the hole's charge as\nwell such that it never vanishes for any value of the hole's angular momentum.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20gr"}

{"prompt": "  We discuss the canonical quantization of systems formulated on discrete\nspace-times. We start by analyzing the quantization of simple mechanical\nsystems with discrete time. The quantization becomes challenging when the\nsystems have anholonomic constraints. We propose a new canonical formulation\nand quantization for such systems in terms of discrete canonical\ntransformations. This allows to construct, for the first time, a canonical\nformulation for general constrained mechanical systems with discrete time. We\nextend the analysis to gauge field theories on the lattice. We consider a\ncomplete canonical formulation, starting from a discrete action, for lattice\nYang--Mills theory discretized in space and Maxwell theory discretized in space\nand time. After completing the treatment, the results can be shown to coincide\nwith the results of the traditional transfer matrix method. We then apply the\nmethod to BF theory, yielding the first lattice treatment for such a theory\never. The framework presented deals directly with the Lorentzian signature\nwithout requiring an Euclidean rotation. The whole discussion is framed in such\na way as to provide a formalism that would allow a consistent, well defined,\ncanonical formulation and quantization of discrete general relativity, which we\nwill discuss in a forthcoming paper.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20gr"}

In perturbative quantum cosmology,\non the other hand, diffeomorphism-invariant boundary conditions lead naturally\nto a singularity-free one-loop wave function of the universe.

This scheme of classification yields twenty four plane symmetric\nkinematic self-similar solutions. Some of these solutions turn out to be\nvacuum.

{"prompt": "  We expand on the idea that spacetime signature should be treated as a\ndynamical degree of freedom in quantum field theory. It has been argued that\nthe probability distribution for signature, induced by massless free fields, is\npeaked at the Lorentzian value uniquely in D=4 dimensions. This argument is\nreviewed, and certain consistency constraints on the generalized signature\n(i.e. the tangent space metric\n$\\eta_{ab}(x)=\\mbox{diag}[e^{i\\theta(x)},1,1,1]$) are derived. It is shown that\nonly one dynamical \"Wick angle\" $\\theta(x)$ can be introduced in the\ngeneralized signature, and the magnitude of fluctuations away from Lorentzian\nsignature $\\delta \\theta = \\pi - \\theta$ is estimated to be of order\n$(l_P/R)^3$, where $l_P$ is the Planck length, and $R$ is the length scale of\nthe Universe. For massless fields, the case of D=2 dimensions and the case of\nsupersymmetry are degenerate, in the sense that no signature is preferred. Mass\neffects lift this degeneracy, and we show that a dynamical origin of Lorentzian\nsignature is also possible for (broken) supersymmetry theories in D=6\ndimensions, in addition to the more general non-supersymmetric case in D=4\ndimensions.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20gr"}
