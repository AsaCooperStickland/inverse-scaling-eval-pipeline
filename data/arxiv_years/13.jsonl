Close to the NCP, the noise level\nincreases to about 180 microJy/PSF, mainly due to additional contamination from\nunsubtracted nearby sources. We estimate that in our best night, we have\nreached a noise level only a factor of 1.4 above the thermal limit set by the\nnoise from our Galaxy and the receivers. Our continuum images are several times\ndeeper than have been achieved previously using the WSRT and GMRT arrays. We\nderive an analytical explanation for the excess noise that we believe to be\nmainly due to sources at large angular separation from the NCP.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 13\n"}

Through finite element\nmodal analysis, the frequencies of drive mode and sense mode are obtained when\nthe length of the PZT block varies from 4.8mm to 5.6mm and the width of the PZT\nblock varies from 3.0mm to 4.0mm. Using a fitting method, the empirical\nformulae with an excellent fit are induced to predict the influence of the\nlength and the width of the PZT block on the drive and sense mode frequencies.\nBased on these empirical formulae, the mode-matching equations are introduced.\nThe analysis results show that for a given thickness of the PZT block, the\neffect of the width on the drive mode frequency is prominant. Conversly, the\neffect of length on the sense mode frequency is dominant. The resonance\nfrequencies, kinetic energy ratios, scale factors of gyroscope are compared to\nevaluate the mode quality. The results show that the kinetic energy in y-axis\ndirection of the drive mode and the kinetic energy in z-axis direction of the\nsense mode increase with the thickness of the PZT block, and consequently the\nscale factor of the gyroscope increases. For a constant thickness of the PZT\nblock the scale factor will decrease as the length increases. Through design\noptimization we present a 20 times improvement in the scale factor of the\nmode-matched gyroscope. Given the thickness of PZT block, the length and the\nwidth will be determined by the mode-matching equations mentioned.

Away from\ntheir perturbative domains, both functions cross over into the same universal\npower-law scaling form governed by the static and dynamic critical exponents\n(as well as an exponent characterizing the quench protocol).

Spectroscopic\nsimilarities with the lower redshift SN2007bi and a decline rate similar to\n56Co decay timescale initially indicated that this transient could be a\ncandidate for a pair instability supernova (PISN) explosion.

{"prompt": "  We present a study exploring the impact of a starburst on the properties of\nthe surrounding circum-galactic medium (CGM): gas located beyond the galaxy's\nstellar body and extending out to the virial radius (200 kpc). We obtained\nultraviolet spectroscopic data from the Cosmic Origin Spectrograph (COS)\nprobing the CGM of 20 low-redshift foreground galaxies using background QSOs.\nOur sample consists of starburst and control galaxies. The latter comprises\nnormal star-forming and passive galaxies with similar stellar masses and impact\nparameters as the starbursts. We used optical spectra from the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey(SDSS) to estimate the properties of the starbursts, inferring\naverage ages of 200 Myrs and burst fractions involving ~10% of their stellar\nmass. The COS data reveal highly ionized gas traced by CIV in 80%(4/5) of the\nstarburst and in 17%(2/12) of the control sample. The two control galaxies with\nCIV absorbers differed from the four starbursts in showing multiple\nlow-ionization transitions and strong saturated Lyman-alpha lines. They\ntherefore appear to be physically different systems. We show that the CIV\nabsorbers in the starburst CGM represent a significant baryon repository. The\nhigh detection rate of this highly ionized material in the starbursts suggests\nthat starburst-driven winds can affect the CGM out to radii as large as 200\nkpc. This is plausible given the inferred properties of the starbursts and the\nknown properties of starburst-driven winds. This would represent the first\ndirect observational evidence of local starbursts impacting the bulk of their\ngaseous halos, and as such provides new evidence of the importance of this kind\nof feedback in the evolution of galaxies.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 13\n"}

The crucial parameter determining\nthe ejecta mass is the radius R_1.35 of a 1.35 M_sun NS. NSs with smaller\nR_1.35 (\"soft\" EoS) eject systematically higher masses. These range from ~10^-3\nM_sun to ~10^-2 M_sun for 1.35-1.35 M_sun binaries and from ~5*10^-3 M_sun to\n~2*10^-2 M_sun for 1.2-1.5 M_sun systems (with kinetic energies between\n~5*10^49 erg and 10^51 erg). Correspondingly, the bolometric peak luminosities\nof the optical transients of symmetric (asymmetric) mergers vary between\n3*10^41 erg/s and 14*10^41 erg/s (9*10^41 erg/s and 14.5*10^41 erg/s) on\ntimescales between ~2 h and ~12 h. If these signals with absolute bolometric\nmagnitudes from -15.0 to -16.7 are measured, the tight correlation of their\nproperties with those of the merging NSs might provide valuable constraints on\nthe high-density EoS. The r-process nucleosynthesis exhibits a remarkable\nrobustness independent of the EoS, producing a nearly solar abundance pattern\nabove mass number 130.

Introducing a negative (positive) gradient in\nY increases (decreases) the enclosed stellar mass near the center of the galaxy\nand leads to systematically smaller (larger) MBH measurements.

The marginal and\nconditional laws are also studied. We show that BBG distribution is infinitely\ndivisible, just as BEG model is. Further, we provide alternative\nrepresentations for the BGG distribution and show that it enjoys a geometric\nstability property. Maximum likelihood estimation and inference are discussed\nand a reparametrization is proposed in order to obtain orthogonality of the\nparameters.

{"prompt": "  The scaling exponent of a hierarchy of cities used to be regarded as a\nfractal parameter. The Pareto exponent was treated as the fractal dimension of\nsize distribution of cities, while the Zipf exponent was treated as the\nreciprocal of the fractal dimension. However, this viewpoint is not exact. In\nthis paper, I will present a new interpretation of the scaling exponent of\nrank-size distributions. The ideas from fractal measure relation and the\nprinciple of dimension consistency are employed to explore the essence of\nPareto's and Zipf's scaling exponents. The Pareto exponent proved to be a ratio\nof the fractal dimension of a network of cities to the average dimension of\ncity population. Accordingly, the Zipf exponent is the reciprocal of this\ndimension ratio. On a digital map, the Pareto exponent can be defined by the\nscaling relation between a map scale and the corresponding number of cities\nbased on this scale. The cities of the United States of America in 1900, 1940,\n1960, and 1980 and Indian cities in 1981, 1991, and 2001 are utilized to\nillustrate the geographical spatial meaning of Pareto's exponent. The results\nsuggest that the Pareto exponent of city-size distribution is not a fractal\ndimension, but a ratio of the urban network dimension to the city population\ndimension.

The FGPB can be installed at the tip of each\nmain tether of an electric solar wind sail (E-sail) so that one can actively\nmanage the tethers to avoid their mutual collisions and to modify the spin rate\nof the sail if needed. This enables a more scalable and modular E-sail than the\nbaseline approach where auxiliary tethers are used for collision avoidance. For\npurely photonic sail applications one can remove the tethers and increase the\nsize of the blades to obtain a novel variant of the heliogyro that can have a\nsignificantly higher packing density than the traditional heliogyro.

To fulfill the interference and delay\nconstraints simultaneously, we propose to perform adaptive zero-forcing\nbeamforming (ZFBF) at cognitive transmitters according to interference channel\nstate information (CSI). To assist the CAHNet to obtain the interference CSI,\nwe use a win-win inter-network cooperation strategy, namely quantized\ninterference CSI feedback from the primary network to CAHNet through a feedback\nlink, under the condition that the CAHNet pays a proper price for it.\nConsidering the scarcity of feedback and power resources, we focus on the\nminimization of the overall resource cost subject to both interference and\ndelay constraints. To solve the problem, we derive a joint feedback and power\ncontrol algorithm amongst multiple links of CAHNet.

{"prompt": "  Fully Developed Turbulence (FDT) is a theoretical asymptotic phenomenon which\ncan only be approximated experimentally or computationally, so its defining\ncharacteristics are hypothetical. It is considered to be a chaotic stationary\nflow field, with self-similar fractalline features. A number of approximate\nmodels exist, often exploiting this self-similarity. The idealized mathematical\nmodel of Fractal Potential Flows is hereby presented, and linked\nphilosophically to the phenomenon of FDT on a free surface, based on its\nexperimental characteristics. The model hinges on the recursive iteration of a\nfluid dynamical transfer operator. The existence of its unique attractor -\ncalled the invariant flow - is shown in an appropriate function space, which\nwill serve as our suggested model for the FDT flow field.

The DLAs and sub-DLAs are\nbelieved to contain a large fraction of neutral gas mass in the Universe. In\nPaper I of the series, we present the results of a search for DLAs and sub-DLAs\nin the ESO-UVES Advanced Data Products dataset of 250 quasars. Here we use an\nunbiased sub-sample of sub-DLAs from this dataset. We build a subset of 122\nquasars ranging from 1.5 <z_em < 5.0, suitable for statistical analysis. The\nstatistical sample is analyzed in conjunction with other sub-DLA samples from\nthe literature. This makes up a combined sample of 89 sub-DLAs over a redshift\npath of $\\Delta z=193$. Redshift evolution of the number density and the line\ndensity are derived for sub-DLAs and compared with the LLSs and DLAs\nmeasurements from the literature. The results indicate that these three classes\nof absorbers are evolving in the redshift interval 1 < z < 5. The column\ndensity distribution, f(N,z), down to the sub-DLA limit is determined. The\nflattening of f_(N,z) in the sub-DLA regime is present in the observations. The\nredshift evolution of f_(N,z) down to sub-DLA regime is also presented,\nindicating the presence of more sub-DLAs at high-redshift as compared to\nlow-redshift. f_(N,z) is further used to determine the neutral gas mass\ndensity, Omega_g, at 1.5 < z < 5.0. The complete sample shows that sub-DLAs\ncontribute 8-20% to the total Omega_g from 1.5 < z < 5.0. In agreement with\nprevious studies, no evolution of Omega_g is seen from low-redshift to\nhigh-redshift, suggesting that star formation solely cannot explain this\nnon-evolution and replenishment of gas and/or recombination of ionized gas is\nneeded.

It was previously\nbelieved that the surface of an ETI must be gapless unless one of these\nsymmetries is broken. A well-known symmetry-preserving, gapless surface\ntermination of an ETI supports an odd number of Dirac cones. In this paper we\ndeduce a symmetry-respecting, gapped surface termination of an ETI, which\ncarries an intrinsic 2d topological order, Moore-Read x anti-semion. The\nMoore-Read sector supports non-Abelian charge 1/4 anyons, while the Abelian,\nanti-semion sector is electrically neutral. Time-reversal symmetry is\nimplemented in this surface phase in a highly non-trivial way. Moreover, it is\nimpossible to realize this phase strictly in 2d, simultaneously preserving its\nimplementation of both the particle number and time-reversal symmetries. A 1d\nedge on the ETI surface between the topologically-ordered phase and the\ntopologically trivial time-reversal-broken phase with a Hall conductivity\nsigma_H = 1/2, carries a right-moving neutral Majorana mode, a right-moving\nbosonic charge mode and a left-moving bosonic neutral mode.

Previous reports have shown\nthat an axial magnetic field induces flux-periodic conductance oscillations\nwhen the electronic states are confined to a shell. This effect is due to the\ncoupling of orbital angular momentum to the magnetic flux. Here, we perform\ncalculations of the energy level structure, and consequently the conductance,\nfor more general cases ranging from a flat potential to strong surface band\nbending. The transverse states are not confined to a shell, but are distributed\nacross the nanowire. It is found that, in general, the subband energy spectrum\nis aperiodic as a function of both gate voltage and magnetic field. In\nprinciple, this allows for precise identification of the occupied subbands from\nthe magnetoconductance patterns of quasi-ballistic devices. The aperiodicity\nbecomes more apparent as the potential flattens. A quantitative method is\nintroduced for matching features in the conductance data to the subband\nstructure resulting from a particular radial potential, where a functional form\nfor the potential is used that depends on two free parameters. Finally, a\nshort-channel InAs nanowire FET device is measured at low temperature in search\nof conductance features that reveal the subband structure. Features are\nidentified and shown to be consistent with three specific subbands. The\nexperiment is analyzed in the context of the weak localization regime, however,\nwe find that the subband effects predicted for ballistic transport should\nremain visible when back scattering dominates over interband scattering, as is\nexpected for this device.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 13\n"}

Actually, it\nseems a difficult goal to be realistically achieved for a number of reasons.\nFirst, the LT range signature of a Galileo-type satellite is as little as $0.5$\nmm over 3-days arcs, corresponding to a node rate of just $\\dot\\Omega_{\\rm\nLT}=2$ milliarcseconds per year (mas yr$^{-1}$). Some tesseral and sectorial\nocean tides such as $K_1,K_2$ induce long-period harmonic node perturbations\nwith frequencies which are integer multiples of the extremely slow Galileo's\nnode rate $\\dot\\Omega$ completing a full cycle in about 40 yr. Thus, over time\nspans $T$ of some years they would act as superimposed semi-secular aliasing\ntrends. Since the coefficients of the $J_{\\ell}$-free multisatellite linear\ncombinations are determined only by the semimajor axis $a$, the eccentricity\n$e$ and the inclination $I$, which are nominally equal for all the Galileo\nsatellites, it is not possible to include all of them.

We consider the\nattractive Hubbard model and focus on the vicinity of a quantum phase\ntransition between semi-metal and superfluid phases. On either side of the\ntransition, we find collective mode excitations that are stable against decay\ninto quasiparticle-pairs. In the semi-metal phase, the collective modes have\n\"Cooperon\" and exciton character. These modes smoothly evolve across the\nquantum phase transition, and become the Anderson-Bogoliubov mode and the Higgs\nmode of the superfluid phase. The collective modes are accommodated within a\nwindow in the quasiparticle-pair continuum, which arises as a consequence of\nthe linear Dirac dispersion on the honeycomb lattice, and allows for sharp\ncollective excitations.

This generalization is then\napplied to geometric models of collinear triatomic chemical reactions (the\nmodels are far from integrable $n$-degree of freedom systems with $n\\geq2$).\nThe application demonstrates that the simpler analytical calculations for the\nhard-wall system may be used to obtain qualitative information with regard to\nthe solution structure of the smooth system and to quantitatively assist in\nfinding solutions of the soft impact system by continuation methods. In\nparticular, stable periodic triatomic configurations are easily located for the\nsmooth highly-nonlinear two and three degree of freedom geometric models.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 13\n"}

We apply\nthis model to five ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs).

In this region\nthe disk luminosity is L_bol ~ L_Edd ln(Mdot/Mdot_Edd), and strong wind arises\nforming a wind funnel above the disk. Outside the spherization radius, the disk\nis thin and its total luminosity is Eddington, L_Edd. The thin disk heats the\nwind from below. From the inner side of the funnel the wind is heated by the\nsupercritical disk. In this paper we do not consider Comptonization in the\ninner hot winds which must cover the deep supercritical disk regions. Our model\nis technically similar to the DISKIR model of Gierlinski et al.

This is\nwhy comparison of different plasma models is today an imperative task aiming at\nunderstanding cross-scale processes in plasmas. We report here the first\ncomparative study of the evolution of a magnetized shear flow, through a\nvariety of different plasma models by using magnetohydrodynamic, Hall-MHD,\ntwo-fluid, hybrid kinetic and full kinetic codes. Kinetic relaxation effects\nare discussed to emphasize the need for kinetic equilibriums to study the\ndynamics of collisionless plasmas in non trivial configurations. Discrepancies\nbetween models are studied both in the linear and in the nonlinear regime of\nthe magnetized Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, to highlight the effects of small\nscale processes on the nonlinear evolution of collisionless plasmas. We\nillustrate how the evolution of a magnetized shear flow depends on the relative\norientation of the fluid vorticity with respect to the magnetic field direction\nduring the linear evolution when kinetic effects are taken into account. Even\nif we found that small scale processes differ between the different models, we\nshow that the feedback from small, kinetic scales to large, fluid scales is\nnegligable in the nonlinear regime.

These results are based on Keck laser-guide-star adaptive optics\nobservations used to identify the young stars and measure their Kp-band\nluminosity function as presented in Do et al. 2013. A Bayesian inference\nmethodology is developed to simultaneously fit the global properties of the\ncluster utilizing the observations and extensive simulations of synthetic star\nclusters.

The age of the cluster is\nbetween 2.5-5.8 Myr with 95% confidence, which is a younger age than typically\nadopted but consistent within the uncertainties of past measurements. The exact\nage of the cluster is difficult to determine since our results show two\ndistinct age solutions (3.9 Myr and 2.8 Myr) due to model degeneracies in the\nrelative number of Wolf-Rayet and OB stars.

Edge-locking is associated with pure imaginary solutions\nof the Bethe equations, which are not commonly encountered in periodic chains.\nIn the one-particle case, at large anisotropies there are two eigenstates with\nimaginary Bethe momenta, related to localization at the two edges. For any\nfinite chain size, one of the two solutions become real as the anisotropy is\nlowered below a certain value.

To clarify this\npoint, we study the simplest model of this sort -- a chain of linearly elastic\ndisks with finite diameter.

{"prompt": "  We study the impact that persistent memory has on the classical rendezvous\nproblem of two mobile computational entities, called robots, in the plane. It\nis well known that, without additional assumptions, rendezvous is impossible if\nthe entities are oblivious (i.e., have no persistent memory) even if the system\nis semi-synchronous (SSynch). It has been recently shown that rendezvous is\npossible even if the system is asynchronous (ASynch) if each robot is endowed\nwith O(1) bits of persistent memory, can transmit O(1) bits in each cycle, and\ncan remember (i.e., can persistently store) the last received transmission.\nThis setting is overly powerful.\n  In this paper we weaken that setting in two different ways: (1) by\nmaintaining the O(1) bits of persistent memory but removing the communication\ncapabilities; and (2) by maintaining the O(1) transmission capability and the\nability to remember the last received transmission, but removing the ability of\nan agent to remember its previous activities. We call the former setting\nfinite-state (FState) and the latter finite-communication (FComm). Note that,\neven though its use is very different, in both settings, the amount of\npersistent memory of a robot is constant.\n  We investigate the rendezvous problem in these two weaker settings. We model\nboth settings as a system of robots endowed with visible lights: in FState, a\nrobot can only see its own light, while in FComm a robot can only see the other\nrobot's light. We prove, among other things, that finite-state robots can\nrendezvous in SSynch, and that finite-communication robots are able to\nrendezvous even in ASynch. All proofs are constructive: in each setting, we\npresent a protocol that allows the two robots to rendezvous in finite time.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 13\n"}

MV is the ratio of the\nminimum social cost over all Nash equilibria to the minimum social cost over\nall mediators, and EV is the ratio of the minimum social cost over all\nmediators to the optimal social cost. This sort of exact characterization is\nuncommon for games with both kinds of network effects. An interesting outcome\nof our results is that both the MV and EV values can be unbounded for our game.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 13\n"}

In this work we address such a process\nfocusing on how the current inner strategies of the information system\n(competition, customer satisfaction) once combined with the gossip may affect\nthe opinions dynamics. A reinforcement effect is particularly evident in the\nsocial network platforms where several and incompatible cultures coexist (e.g,\npro or against the existence of chemical trails and reptilians, the new world\norder conspiracy and so forth). We introduce a computational model of opinion\ndynamics which accounts for the coexistence of media and gossip as separated\nbut interdependent mechanisms influencing the opinions evolution. Individuals\nmay change their opinions under the contemporary pressure of the information\nsupplied by the media and the opinions of their social contacts. We stress the\neffect of the media communication patterns by considering both the simple case\nwhere each medium mimics the behavior of the most successful one (in order to\nmaximize the audience) and the case where there is polarization and thus\ncompetition among media reported information (in order to preserve and satisfy\ntheir segmented audience).

{"prompt": "  Heavy isocurvature fields may have a strong influence on the low energy\ndynamics of curvature perturbations during inflation, as long as the\ninflationary trajectory becomes non-geodesic in the multi-field target space\n(the landscape). If fields orthogonal to the inflationary trajectory are\nsufficiently heavy, one expects a reliable effective field theory describing\nthe low energy dynamics of curvature perturbations, with self-interactions\ndetermined by the shape of the inflationary trajectory. Previous work analyzing\nthe role of heavy-fields during inflation have mostly focused in the effects on\ncurvature perturbations due to a single heavy-field. In this article we extend\nthe results of these works by studying models of inflation in which curvature\nperturbations interact with two heavy-fields. We show that the second\nheavy-field (orthogonal to both tangent and normal directions of the\ninflationary trajectory) may significantly affect the evolution of curvature\nmodes. We compute the effective field theory for the low energy curvature\nperturbations obtained by integrating out the two heavy-fields and show that\nthe presence of the second heavy-field implies the existence of additional\nself-interactions not accounted for in the single heavy-field case.

{"prompt": "  We present the analysis of a deep Chandra observation of a ~2L_* late-type\ngalaxy, ESO 137-002, in the closest rich cluster A3627. The Chandra data reveal\na long (>40 kpc) and narrow tail with a nearly constant width (~3 kpc) to the\nsoutheast of the galaxy, and a leading edge ~1.5 kpc from the galaxy center on\nthe upstream side of the tail. The tail is most likely caused by the nearly\nedge-on stripping of ESO 137-002's ISM by ram pressure, compared to the nearly\nface-on stripping of ESO 137-001 discussed in our previous work. Spectral\nanalysis of individual regions along the tail shows that the gas throughout it\nhas a rather constant temperature, ~1 keV, very close to the temperature of the\ntails of ESO 137-001, if the same atomic database is used. The derived gas\nabundance is low (~0.2 solar with the single-kT model), an indication of the\nmultiphase nature of the gas in the tail. The mass of the X-ray tail is only a\nsmall fraction (<5%) of the initial ISM mass of the galaxy, suggesting that the\nstripping is most likely at an early stage. However, with any of the single-kT,\ndouble-kT and multi-kT models we tried, the tail is always \"over-pressured\"\nrelative to the surrounding ICM, which could be due to the uncertainties in the\nabundance, thermal vs. non-thermal X-ray emission, or magnetic support in the\nICM. The H-alpha data from SOAR show a ~21 kpc tail spatially coincident with\nthe X-ray tail, as well as a secondary tail (~12 kpc long) to the east of the\nmain tail diverging at an angle of ~23 degrees and starting at a distance of\n~7.5 kpc from the nucleus. At the position of the secondary H-alpha tail, the\nX-ray emission is also enhanced at the ~2 sigma level. We compare the tails of\nESO 137-001 and ESO 137-002, and also compare the tails to simulations. Both\nthe similarities and differences of the tails pose challenges to the\nsimulations.

{"prompt": "  Genetic association studies, in particular the genome-wide association study\ndesign, have provided a wealth of novel insights into the aetiology of a wide\nrange of human diseases and traits. The next challenge consists of\nunderstanding the molecular basis of these associations. The integration of\nmultiple association datasets, including gene expression datasets, can\ncontribute to this goal. We have developed a novel statistical methodology to\nassess whether two association signals are consistent with a shared causal\nvariant. An application is the integration of disease scans with expression\nquantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, but any pair of GWAS datasets can be\nintegrated in this framework. We demonstrate the value of the approach by\nreanalysing a gene expression dataset in 966 liver samples with a published\nmeta-analysis of lipid traits including >100, 000 individuals of European\nancestry. Combining all lipid biomarkers, our reanalysis supported 29 out of 38\nreported colocalisation results with eQTLs and identified 14 new colocalisation\nresults, highlighting the value of a formal statistical test. In two cases of\nreported eQTL-lipid pairs (IFT172, TBKBP1) for which our analysis suggests that\nthe eQTL pattern is not consistent with the lipid association, we identify\nalternative colocalisation results with GCKR and KPNB1, indicating that these\ngenes are more likely to be causal in these genomic intervals. A key feature of\nthe method is the ability to derive the output statistics from single SNP\nsummary statistics, hence making it possible to perform systematic\nmeta-analysis type comparisons across multiple GWAS datasets\n(http://coloc.cs.ucl.ac.uk/coloc/).

If not accounted for, these biases introduce systematic errors\nfor cosmological measurements. Here we quantify these systematic errors, using\nconvergence maps from a suite of ray-tracing N-body simulations. At the cut-off\nmagnitude m of on-going and planned major weak lensing surveys, the logarithmic\nslope of the cumulative number counts s = dlog[n(>m)]/dlog(m) is in the range\n0.1 < s < 0.5. At s = 0.2, expected in the I band for LSST, the inferred values\nof Omega_m, w and sigma_8 are biased by many sigma (where sigma denotes the\nmarginalized error) and therefore the biases will need to be carefully modeled.\nWe also find that the parameters are biased differently in the (Omega_m, w,\nsigma_8) parameter space when the power spectrum and when the peak counts are\nused. In particular, w derived from the power spectrum is less affected than w\nderived from peak counts, while the opposite is true for the best-constrained\ncombination of [sigma_8 Omega_m^gamma] (with gamma=0.62 from the power spectrum\nand gamma = 0.48 from peak counts).

To overcome this degeneracy, the multi-wavelength emission (from\nradio to gamma rays) from individual supernova remnants has been studied and in\na few cases it has been possible to ascribe the gamma-ray emission to one of\nthe two processes (hadronic or leptonic). Here we adopt a different approach\nand, instead of a case-by-case study we aim for a population study and we\ncompute the number of supernova remnants which are expected to be seen in TeV\ngamma rays above a given flux under the assumption that these objects indeed\nare the sources of cosmic rays.

By analyzing such dispersively acquired data\nfrom millimeter sized atomic samples, we demonstrate that field gradients can\nbe determined with an accuracy of $\\sim25$ nT/mm. The dispersive probing of\ninhomogeneously broadened Rabi oscillations in prolate samples opens up a path\nto gradiometry with bandwidths in the kilohertz domain.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 13\n"}

For the case of corundum, we find that the 13$\\mu$m\nemission feature - seen in the IR spectra of many AGB stars - can very well be\nassigned to this mineral species. The best fit of the feature is achieved with\noblate corundum grains at mean temperatures around 550 K. Spinel remains a\nviable carrier of the 13$\\mu$m feature as well, but only for T < 300 K and\nnearly spherical grain shapes. Under such circumstances, spinel grains may also\naccount for the 31.8$\\mu$m band that is frequently seen in sources of the\n13$\\mu$m feature and which has not yet been identified with certainty.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 13\n"}

{"prompt": "  Rapid accretion of cold gas plays a crucial role in getting gas into\ngalaxies. It has been suggested that this accretion proceeds along narrow\nstreams that might also directly drive the turbulence in galactic gas,\ndynamical disturbances, and bulge formation. In cosmological simulations,\nhowever, it is impossible to isolate and hence disentangle the effect of\naccretion from internal instabilities and mergers. Moreover, in most\ncosmological simulations, the phase structure and turbulence in the ISM arising\nfrom stellar feedback are treated in a sub-grid manner, so that feedback cannot\ngenerate ISM turbulence. In this paper we therefore test the effects of cold\nstreams in extremely high-resolution simulations of otherwise isolated galaxy\ndisks using detailed models for star formation and feedback; we then include or\nexclude mock cold flows falling onto the galaxies with accretion rates,\nvelocities and geometry set to maximize their effect on the disk. We find: (1)\nTurbulent velocity dispersions in gas disks are identical with or without the\ncold flow; the energy injected by the flow is dissipated where it meets the\ndisk. (2) In runs without stellar feedback, the presence of a cold flow has\nessentially no effect on runaway local collapse, resulting in star formation\nrates (SFRs) that are far too large. (3) Disks in runs with feedback and cold\nflows have higher SFRs, but only insofar as they have more gas. (4) Because\nflows are extended relative to the disk, they do not trigger strong resonant\nresponses and so induce weak morphological perturbation (bulge formation via\ninstabilities is not accelerated). (5) However, flows can thicken the disk by\ndirect contribution of out-of-plane streams. We conclude that while inflows are\ncritical over cosmological timescales to determine the supply and angular\nmomentum of gas disks, they have weak instantaneous dynamical effects on\ngalaxies.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 13\n"}

A\ncutoff where the particle-size distribution turns over must exist, but the\nposition and shape of it is not clear from existing studies.\n  Using a series of solar occultations performed by the VIMS instrument\non-board Cassini in the near-infrared, we are able to measure light forward\nscattered by particles in the A and C rings. With a model of diffraction by\nring particles, and the previous radio work as a constraint on the slope of the\nparticle size distribution, we estimate the minimum particle size using a\ntruncated power-law size distribution. The C Ring shows a minimum particle size\nof $4.1^{+3.8}_{-1.3}$ mm, with an assumed power law index of q=3.1 and a\nmaximum particle size of 10 m.\n  The A Ring signal shows a similar level of scattered flux, but modeling is\ncomplicated by the presence of self-gravity wakes and higher optical depths.

By combining existing mid-IR\nspectroscopy and new Herschel SPIRE submm photometry from the HerMES program,\nwe derived robust total infrared luminosity (LIR) and dust mass (Md) estimates\nand infered the relative contribution of the AGN to the infrared energy budget\nof the sources. We found that the total infrared emission of galaxies with weak\n6.2um PAH emission (EW<0.2um) is dominated by AGN activity, while for galaxies\nwith EW>0.2um more than 50% of the LIR arises from star formation. We also\nfound that for galaxies detected in the 250-500um Herschel bands an AGN has a\nstatistically insignificant effect on the temperature of the cold dust and the\nfar-IR colours of the host galaxy, which are primarily shaped by star formation\nactivity. For star-forming galaxies we reveal an anti-correlation between the\nLIR-to-rest-frame 8um luminosity ratio, IR8 = LIR\\L8, and the strength of PAH\nfeatures. We found that this anti-correlation is primarily driven by variations\nin the PAHs emission, and not by variations in the 5-15um mid-IR continuum\nemission.

The 9% nulls are found to be largely confined to the\ndominant B and N modes, and, in the N mode, create alternating bunches of nulls\nand emission in a quasi-periodic manner with an averaged fluctuation rate of\nabout 12 rotation periods ($P_1$). We explore the assumption that the apparent\ndrift is the first alias of a faster drift of subbeams equally spaced around\nthe cones. This is shown to imply that all modes A, B and C have a common\ncirculation time of 12 $P_1$ and differ only in the number of subbeams. This\ntimescale is on the same order as predicted by the classic {\\bf E}$\\times${\\bf\nB} drift and also coincides with the N-mode modulation. We therefore arrive at\na picture where the circulation speed remains roughly invariant while the\nsubbeams progressively diminish in number from modes A to B to C, and are then\nre-established during the N mode. We suggest that aliasing combined with\nsubbeam loss may be responsible for apparently dramatic changes in drift rates\nin other pulsars.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 13\n"}

{"prompt": "  The conditions that a planet must fulfill to be habitable are not precisely\nknown. However, it is comparatively easier to define conditions under which a\nplanet is very likely not habitable. Finding such conditions is important as it\ncan help select, in an ensemble of potentially observable planets, which ones\nshould be observed in greater detail for characterization studies. Assuming, as\nin the Earth, that the presence of a C-cycle is a necessary condition for\nlong-term habitability, we derive, as a function of the planetary mass, a\nradius above which a planet is likely not habitable. We compute the maximum\nradius a planet can have to fulfill two constraints: surface conditions\ncompatible with the existence of liquid water, and no ice layer at the bottom\nof a putative global ocean. We demonstrate that, above a given radius, these\ntwo constraints cannot be met. We compute internal structure models of planets,\nusing a five-layer model (core, inner mantle, outer mantle, ocean, and\natmosphere), for different masses and composition of the planets (in\nparticular, the Fe/Si ratio of the planet). Our results show that for planets\nin the Super-Earth mass range (1-12 Mearth), the maximum that a planet, with a\ncomposition similar to that of the Earth, can have varies between 1.7 and 2.2\nRearth. This radius is reduced when considering planets with higher Fe/Si\nratios and taking radiation into account when computing the gas envelope\nstructure.

Especially, BM-SCO has\natomically-ordered one-dimensional vacancy channels, which can accommodate\nadditional oxygen. Moreover, SrCoO$_{x}$ exhibits a wide spectrum of physical\nproperties depending on the oxygen stoichiometry.

Using the\nconcordance LCDM halo mass function for the latter, we obtain the M_h-L_X\nrelation required to match the redshift-dependent AGN X-ray luminosity function\nknown from X-ray observations.

The proposed\noptimization strategies improve the scaling of performance with number of cores\nand width of vector units (applicable to many-core SIMD processors such as\nIntel Xeon Phi and GPUs), resulting in cost-effectiveness, energy efficiency,\nand higher speed on multi-core x86 processors.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 13\n"}

{"prompt": "  In the last few years, over 43 millisecond radio pulsars have been discovered\nby targeted searches of unidentified gamma-ray sources found by the Fermi\nGamma-Ray Space Telescope. A large fraction of these millisecond pulsars are in\ncompact binaries with low-mass companions. These systems often show eclipses of\nthe pulsar signal and are commonly known as black widows and redbacks because\nthe pulsar is gradually destroying its companion. In this paper, we report on\nthe optical discovery of four strongly irradiated millisecond pulsar\ncompanions. All four sources show modulations of their color and luminosity at\nthe known orbital periods from radio timing. Light curve modelling of our\nexploratory data shows that the equilibrium temperature reached on the\ncompanion's dayside with respect to their nightside is consistent with about\n10-30% of the available spin-down energy from the pulsar being reprocessed to\nincrease the companion's dayside temperature. This value compares well with the\nrange observed in other irradiated pulsar binaries and offers insights about\nthe energetics of the pulsar wind and the production of gamma-ray emission. In\naddition, this provides a simple way of estimating the brightness of irradiated\npulsar companions given the pulsar spin-down luminosity. Our analysis also\nsuggests that two of the four new irradiated pulsar companions are only\npartially filling their Roche lobe. Some of these sources are relatively bright\nand represent good targets for spectroscopic follow-up. These measurements\ncould enable, among other things, mass determination of the neutron stars in\nthese systems.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 13\n"}

Although the core molecular machinery for actin\nnetwork growth is well preserved in most cases, the geometry of the propelled\nobstacle can vary considerably.

Here we derive several\ncontinuum equations for the orientation distribution of filaments growing\nbehind stiff obstacles of various shapes and validate the predicted steady\nstate orientation patterns by stochastic computer simulations based on discrete\nfilaments. We use an ordinary differential equation approach to demonstrate\nthat for flat obstacles of finite size, two fundamentally different orientation\npatterns peaked at either +35/-35 or +70/0/-70 degrees exhibit mutually\nexclusive stability, in agreement with earlier results for flat obstacles of\nvery large lateral extension.

This problem is addressed\nin this paper in the context of multiscale factorization methods for molecular\ndynamics. These methods capture the crosstalk between atomic and coarse-grained\nscales arising in macromolecular systems. This crosstalk is accounted for by\nTrotter factorization, which is used to separate the all-atom from the\ncoarse-grained phases of the computation. In this approach, short molecular\ndynamics runs are used to advance in time the coarse-grained variables, which\nin turn guide the all-atom state.

There, the low energy\nstates of a nonlinear electronic oscillator are isolated and addressed as a\nqubit. These qubits are capacitively coupled to the modes of a\nmicrowave-frequency transmission line resonator which serves as a quantum\ncommunication bus. Microwave electrical pulses are applied to the resonator to\nmanipulate or measure the qubit state. State control is calibrated using\ndiagnostic sequences that expose systematic errors. Hybridization of the\nresonator with the qubit gives it a nonlinear response when driven strongly,\nuseful for amplifying the measurement signal to enhance accuracy. Qubits\ncoupled to the same bus may coherently interact with one another via the\nexchange of virtual photons. A two-qubit conditional phase gate mediated by\nthis interaction can deterministically entangle its targets, and is used to\ngenerate two-qubit Bell states and three-qubit GHZ states. These three-qubit\nstates are of particular interest because they redundantly encode quantum\ninformation.

{"prompt": "  CONTEXT. Because of the presence of rotation and accretion disks, classical T\nTauri stars have symmetry planes that are normally inclined relative to the\nplane of the sky. The inclination angles affect the observed spectral\nproperties of these objects. AIMS. We study the influence of the inclination\nangles on classical T Tauri star spectra in an empirical manner. METHODS.\nPublished inclination angles, derived from the stellar photospheric rotation or\nfrom spatially resolved circumstellar disk observations, are compared with\nvarious observed spectral properties, and correlations are established and\ninvestigated. RESULTS. Inclinations derived from the stellar rotation are found\nto be much less accurate than the published disk inclinations, and no\nsignificant correlations between spectral properties and inclinations based on\nrotation data could be detected. In contrast, significant correlations are\nfound between the disk inclination angles and the apparent velocities observed\nfor the forbidden emission lines and the wind absorption features of permitted\nlines. These data support the assumption of cone-like polar winds with opening\nangles smaller than $\\approx 45^\\circ$. Other spectral features show weaker or\nno inclination dependence. Using these results, the true (deprojected) flow\nvelocities of the polar winds are derived for the investigated sample of T\nTauri stars. Deprojected wind-ejection velocities appear to differ by a factor\nof two among the stars in our sample, which spans a range of mass-loss rates\nfrom $10^{-10} $M$_\\odot$/yr to $3 \\times 10^{-7} $M$_\\odot$/yr.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 13\n"}
{"prompt": "  It is well-known how to control the spatial output from a laser, with most\nsolutions to date involving customised intra-cavity elements in the form of\napertures, diffractive optics and free-form mirrors. These optical elements\nrequire considerable design and fabrication effort and suffer from the further\ndisadvantage of being immutably connected to the selection of a particular\nspatial mode. Consequently, most laser systems are designed for the ubiquitous\nGaussian mode, whereas it is clear that there are many instances when a\ncustomised mode would be preferable. We overcome these limitations with the\nfirst digital laser, comprising an electrically addressed reflective phase-only\nspatial light modulator as an intra-cavity holographic mirror. The phase and\namplitude of the holographic mirror may be controlled as simply as writing a\nnew gray-scale image (computer generated hologram) to the device: on-demand\nlaser modes. We show that we can digitally control the laser modes with ease,\nalbeit with higher round-trip losses and thus requiring higher gain, and\ndemonstrate the versatility of the technique by switching between several\nspatial modes in an otherwise standard solid-state laser resonator.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 13\n"}

{"prompt": "  The Fermi and Swift satellites, together with ground based Cherenkov\ntelescopes, has greatly improved our knowledge of blazars, namely Flat Spectrum\nRadio Quasars and BL Lac objects, since all but the most powerful emit most of\ntheir electro-magnetic output at gamma-ray energies, while the very powerful\nblazars emit mostly in the hard X-ray region of the spectrum. Often they show\ncoordinated variability at different frequencies, suggesting that in these\ncases the same population of electrons is at work, in a single zone of the jet.\nThe location of this region along the jet is a matter of debate. The jet power\ncorrelates with the mass accretion rate, with jets existing at all values of\ndisk luminosities, measured in Eddington units, sampled so far. The most\npowerful blazars show clear evidence of the emission from their disks, and this\nhas revived methods of finding the black hole mass and accretion rate by\nmodelling a disk spectrum to the data. Being so luminous, blazars can be\ndetected also at very high redshift, and therefore are a useful tool to explore\nthe far universe. One interesting line of research concerns how heavy are their\nblack holes at high redshifts. If we associate the presence of a relativistic\njet with a fastly spinning black hole, then we naively expect that the\naccretion efficiency is larger than for non-spinning holes. As a consequence,\nthe black hole mass in jetted systems should grow at a slower rate. In turn,\nthis would imply that, at high redshifts, the heaviest black holes should be in\nradio-quiet quasars. We instead have evidences of the opposite, challenging our\nsimple ideas of how a black hole grows.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 13\n"}

By investigating the femtosecond dynamics of\nthe optical properties of Y-Bi2212 crystals over the 0.5-2 eV energy range, we\ndisentangle the electronic and phononic contributions to the generalized\nelectron-boson Eliashberg function, showing that the spectral distribution of\nthe electronic excitations, such as spin fluctuations and current loops, and\nthe strength of their interaction with quasiparticles can account for the high\ncritical temperature of the superconducting phase transition.

{"prompt": "  We report the finding of an azimuthal dynamo wave of a low-order (m=1) mode\nin direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent convection in spherical\nshells. Such waves are predicted by mean field dynamo theory and have been\nobtained previously in mean-field models. Observational results both from\nphotometry and Doppler imaging have revealed persistent drifts of spots for\nseveral rapidly rotating stars, but, although an azimuthal dynamo wave has been\nproposed as a possible mechanism responsible for this behavior, it has been\njudged as unlikely, as practical evidence for such waves from DNS has been\nlacking. The large-scale magnetic field in our DNS, which is due to\nself-consistent dynamo action, is dominated by a retrograde m=1 mode. Its\npattern speed is nearly independent of latitude and does not reflect the speed\nof the differential rotation at any depth. The extrema of magnetic m=1\nstructures coincide reasonably with the maxima of m=2 structures of the\ntemperature. These results provide direct support for the observed drifts being\ndue to an azimuthal dynamo wave.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 13\n"}
