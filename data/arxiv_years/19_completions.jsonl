{"prompt": "  In this paper, a 3D patch-based fully dense and fully convolutional network\n(FD-FCN) is proposed for fast and accurate segmentation of subcortical\nstructures in T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. Developed from the seminal\nFCN with an end-to-end learning-based approach and constructed by newly\ndesigned dense blocks including a dense fully-connected layer, the proposed\nFD-FCN is different from other FCN-based methods and leads to an outperformance\nin the perspective of both efficiency and accuracy. Compared with the U-shaped\narchitecture, FD-FCN discards the upsampling path for model fitness. To\nalleviate the problem of parameter explosion, the inputs of dense blocks are no\nlonger directly passed to subsequent layers. This architecture of FD-FCN brings\na great reduction on both memory and time consumption in training process.\nAlthough FD-FCN is slimmed down, in model competence it gains better capability\nof dense inference than other conventional networks. This benefits from the\nconstruction of network architecture and the incorporation of redesigned dense\nblocks. The multi-scale FD-FCN models both local and global context by\nembedding intermediate-layer outputs in the final prediction, which encourages\nconsistency between features extracted at different scales and embeds\nfine-grained information directly in the segmentation process. In addition,\ndense blocks are rebuilt to enlarge the receptive fields without significantly\nincreasing parameters, and spectral coordinates are exploited for spatial\ncontext of the original input patch. The experiments were performed over the\nIBSR dataset, and FD-FCN produced an accurate segmentation result of overall\nDice overlap value of 89.81% for 11 brain structures in 53 seconds, with at\nleast 3.66% absolute improvement of dice accuracy than state-of-the-art 3D\nFCN-based methods.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 22"}

The IRS is composed of a large\narray of scattering elements, which can be individually configured to generate\nadditional phase shifts to the signal reflections.

The outflow speed can be expressed as $|u_{\\rm\nout}|=\\sqrt{3/2}mc_{\\rm s}$ $(R_{\\rm Bondi}\\leq R_{\\rm Hill})$ or $|u_{\\rm\nout}|=\\sqrt{3/2}(m/3)^{1/3} c_{\\rm s}$ ($R_{\\rm Bondi}\\geq R_{\\rm Hill}$),\nwhere $c_{\\rm s}$ is the isothermal sound speed and $R_{\\rm Hill}$ is the Hill\nradius.

Consequently, one might expect that STDP would induce strong\ncompetition between different rhythmicity channels thus preventing the\nmultiplexing of information across different frequency channels. This study\nexplored whether STDP facilitates the multiplexing of information across\nmultiple frequency channels, and if so, under what conditions. We investigated\nthe STDP dynamics in the framework of a model consisting of two competing\nsubpopulations of neurons that synapse in a feedforward manner onto a single\npostsynaptic neuron. Each sub-population was assumed to oscillate in an\nindependent manner and in a different frequency band. To investigate the STDP\ndynamics, a mean field Fokker-Planck theory was developed in the limit of the\nslow learning rate. Surprisingly, our theory predicted limited interactions\nbetween the different sub-groups. Our analysis further revealed that the\ninteraction between these channels was mainly mediated by the shared component\nof the mean activity. Next, we generalized these results beyond the simplistic\nmodel using numerical simulations.

Nevertheless, all the synaptic weights\nremained dynamic and did not converge to a fixed point.

{"prompt": "  We consider a Fog Radio Access Network (F-RAN) with a Base Band Unit (BBU) in\nthe cloud and multiple cache-enabled enhanced Remote Radio Heads (eRRHs). The\nsystem aims at delivering contents on demand with minimal average latency from\na time-varying library of popular contents. Information about uncached\nrequested files can be transferred from the cloud to the eRRHs by following\neither backhaul or fronthaul modes. The backhaul mode transfers fractions of\nthe requested files, while the fronthaul mode transmits quantized baseband\nsamples as in Cloud-RAN (C-RAN). The backhaul mode allows the caches of the\neRRHs to be updated, which may lower future delivery latencies. In contrast,\nthe fronthaul mode enables cooperative C-RAN transmissions that may reduce the\ncurrent delivery latency. Taking into account the trade-off between current and\nfuture delivery performance, this paper proposes an adaptive selection method\nbetween the two delivery modes to minimize the long-term delivery latency.\nAssuming an unknown and time-varying popularity model, the method is based on\nmodel-free Reinforcement Learning (RL).

The elastohydrodynamic problem is\nformulated and solved using the classic method of images through expressing the\nhydrodynamic flow fields as a multipole expansion involving higher-order\nderivatives of the free-space Green's function. In the quasi-steady limit, we\ndemonstrate that the particle self-mobility function of a particle moving\ntangent to the surface of the cavity is larger than that predicted inside a\nrigid stationary cavity of equal size. This difference is justified by the fact\nthat a stationary rigid cavity introduces additional hindrance to the\ntranslational motion of the encapsulated particle, resulting in a reduction of\nits hydrodynamic mobility.

Although it\nhas been well known for decades that the classical communication capacity over\nlossy and noisy bosonic channels can be significantly enhanced by entanglement,\nno practical encoding and decoding schemes are available to realize any\nentanglement-enabled advantage. Here, we report structured encoding and\ndecoding schemes for such an entanglement-assisted communication scenario.\nSpecifically, we show that phase encoding on the entangled two-mode squeezed\nvacuum state saturates the entanglement-assisted classical communication\ncapacity over a very noisy channel and overcomes the fundamental limit of\ncovert communication without entanglement assistance. We then construct\nreceivers for optimum hypothesis testing protocols under discrete phase\nmodulation and for optimum noisy phase estimation protocols under continuous\nphase modulation. Our results pave the way for entanglement-assisted\ncommunication and sensing in the radio-frequency and microwave spectral ranges.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 14"}

{"prompt": "  Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications are evolving as a promising\ntechnology to meet the ever increasing data rate requirements. However, high\ndirectivity and severe path loss make it vulnerable to blockages, which could\nbe frequent in indoor or urban environments. To address this issue, intelligent\nreflecting surfaces (IRSs) are introduced to provide additional adjustable\nreflected paths. Most prior works assume that elements of IRSs have an infinite\nphase resolution, which is difficult to be realized in practical systems. In\nthis paper, IRSs with low-resolution phase shifters are considered. We aim to\nmaximize the receive signal power at the user by jointly optimizing discrete\nphase shifts of IRSs and the transmit beamforming vector at the base station\nfor mmWave downlink systems. An analytical near-optimal solution is developed\nby exploiting some important characteristics of mmWave channels. Our\ntheoretical analysis reveals that low-resolution phase shifters can still\nachieve a receive signal power that increases quadratically with the number of\nreflecting elements.

{"prompt": "  The strength of obfuscated software has increased over the recent years.\nCompiler based obfuscation has become the de facto standard in the industry and\nrecent papers also show that injection of obfuscation techniques is done at the\ncompiler level.

We\nshow how binary code can be lifted back into the compiler intermediate language\nLLVM-IR and explain how we recover the control flow graph of an obfuscated\nbinary function with an iterative control flow graph construction algorithm\nbased on compiler optimizations and SMT solving. Our approach does not make any\nassumptions about the obfuscated code, but instead uses strong compiler\noptimizations available in LLVM and Souper Optimizer to simplify away the\nobfuscation. Our experimental results show that this approach can be effective\nto weaken or even remove the applied obfuscation techniques like constant\nunfolding, certain arithmetic-based opaque expressions, dead code insertions,\nbogus control flow or integer encoding found in public and commercial\nobfuscators. The recovered LLVM-IR can be further processed by custom\ndeobfuscation passes that are now applied at the same level as the injected\nobfuscation techniques or recompiled with one of the available LLVM backends.\nThe presented work is implemented in a deobfuscation tool called SATURN.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 19"}

{"prompt": "  The security of cyber-physical systems, from self-driving cars to medical\ndevices, depends on their underlying multi-hop wireless networks. Yet, the lack\nof trusted central infrastructures and limited nodes' resources make securing\nthese networks challenging. Recent works on key pre-distribution schemes, where\nnodes communicate over encrypted overlay paths, provide an appealing solution\nbecause of their distributed, computationally light-weight nature. Alas, these\nschemes share a glaring security vulnerability: the two ends of every overlay\nlink can decrypt---and potentially modify and alter---the message. Plus, the\nlonger overlay paths impose traffic overhead and increase latency.\n  We present a novel routing mechanism, KPsec, to address these issues. KPsec\ndeploys multiple disjoint paths and an initial key-exchange phase to secure\nend-to-end communications. After the initial key-exchange phase, traffic in\nKPsec follows the shortest paths and, in contrast to key pre-distribution\nschemes, intermediate nodes cannot decrypt it. We measure the security and\nperformance of KPsec as well as three state-of-the-art key pre-distribution\nschemes using a real 10-node testbed and large-scale simulations. Our\nexperiments show that, in addition to its security benefits, KPsec results in\n$5-15\\%$ improvement in network throughput, up to $75\\%$ reduction in latency,\nand an order of magnitude reduction in energy consumption.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 22"}

{"prompt": "  Individual chemically active drops suspended in a surfactant solution were\nobserved to self-propel spontaneously with straight, helical, or chaotic\ntrajectories. To elucidate how these drops can exhibit such strikingly\ndifferent dynamics and `decide' what to do, we propose a minimal axisymmetric\nmodel of a spherical active drop, and show that simple and linear interface\nproperties can lead to both steady self-propulsion of the droplet as well as\nchaotic behavior. The model includes two different mobility mechanisms, namely,\ndiffusiophoresis and the Marangoni effect, that convert self-generated\ngradients of surfactant concentration into the flow at the droplet surface. In\nturn, surface-driven flow initiates surfactant advection that is the only\nnonlinear mechanism and, thus, the only source of dynamical complexity in our\nmodel. Numerical investigation of the fully-coupled hydrodynamic and advection\ndiffusion problems reveals that strong advection (e.g., large droplet size) may\ndestabilize a steadily self-propelling drop; once destabilized, the droplet\nspontaneously stops and a symmetric extensile flow emerges. If advection is\nstrengthened even further in comparison with molecular diffusion, the droplet\nmay perform chaotic oscillations. Our results indicate that the thresholds of\nthese instabilities depend heavily on the balance between diffusiophoresis and\nthe Marangoni effect. Using linear stability analysis, we demonstrate that\ndiffusiophoresis promotes the onset of high-order modes of monotonic\ninstability of the motionless drop. We argue that diffusiophoresis has a\nsimilar effect on the instabilities of a moving drop.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 17"}
