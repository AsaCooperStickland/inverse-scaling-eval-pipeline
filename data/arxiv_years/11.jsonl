{"prompt": "  We re-analyse photometric near-infrared data in order to investigate why it\nis so hard to get a consensus for the shape and density law of the bulge, as\nseen from the literature. To solve the problem we use the Besancon Galaxy Model\nto provide a scheme for parameter fitting of the structural characteristics of\nthe bulge region. The fitting process allows the determination of the global\nshape of the bulge main structure.\n  We explore various parameters and shape for the bulge/bar structure based on\nFerrer's ellipsoids and fit the shape of the inner disc in the same process.\nThe results show that the main structure is a quite standard triaxial boxy\nbar/bulge with an orientation of about 13 degree with respect to the Sun-centre\ndirection. But the fit is greatly improved when we add a second structure,\nwhich is a longer and thicker ellipsoid. We emphasize that our first ellipsoid\nrepresent the main boxy bar of the Galaxy, and that the thick bulge could be\neither a classical bulge slightly flattened by the effect of the bar potential,\nor a inner thick disc counterpart. We show that the double clump seen at\nintermediate latitudes can be reproduced by adding a slight flare to the bar.\nIn order to better characterize the populations, we further simulate several\nfields which have been surveyed in spectroscopy and for which metallicity\ndistribution function (MDF) are available. The model is in good agreement with\nthese MDF along the minor axis if we assume that the main bar has a mean solar\nmetallicity and the second thicker population has a lower metallicity.

Cyclic field\nvariations, characteristic for the solar magnetic field, are often explained by\nan important omega-effect, i.e. by the stretching of field lines due to strong\ndifferential rotation. Aims: The dynamo mechanism of a convective, oscillatory\ndynamo model is investigated. Methods: We solve the MHD-equations for a\nconducting Boussinesq fluid in a rotating spherical shell. For a resulting\noscillatory model, dynamo coefficients have been computed with the help of the\nso-called test-field method. Subsequently, these coefficients have been used in\na mean-field calculation in order to explore the underlying dynamo mechanism.\nResults: Although the rather strong differential rotation present in this model\ninfluences the magnetic field, the omega-effect alone is not responsible for\nits cyclic time variation. If the omega-effect is suppressed, the resulting\nalpha^2-dynamo remains oscillatory. Surprisingly, the corresponding alpha-omega\ndynamo leads to a non-oscillatory magnetic field.

{"prompt": "  We study dynamo action in a convective layer of electrically-conducting,\ncompressible fluid, rotating about the vertical axis. At the upper and lower\nbounding surfaces, perfectly-conducting boundary conditions are adopted for the\nmagnetic field. Two different levels of thermal stratification are considered.\nIf the magnetic diffusivity is sufficiently small, the convection acts as a\nsmall-scale dynamo. Using a definition for the magnetic Reynolds number $R_M$\nthat is based upon the horizontal integral scale and the horizontally-averaged\nvelocity at the mid-layer of the domain, we find that rotation tends to reduce\nthe critical value of $R_M$ above which dynamo action is observed. Increasing\nthe level of thermal stratification within the layer does not significantly\nalter the critical value of $R_M$ in the rotating calculations, but it does\nlead to a reduction in this critical value in the non-rotating cases. At the\nhighest computationally-accessible values of the magnetic Reynolds number, the\nsaturation levels of the dynamo are similar in all cases, with the mean\nmagnetic energy density somewhere between 4 and 9% of the mean kinetic energy\ndensity. To gain further insights into the differences between rotating and\nnon-rotating convection, we quantify the stretching properties of each flow by\nmeasuring Lyapunov exponents. Away from the boundaries, the rate of stretching\ndue to the flow is much less dependent upon depth in the rotating cases than it\nis in the corresponding non-rotating calculations. It is also shown that the\neffects of rotation significantly reduce the magnetic energy dissipation in the\nlower part of the layer. We also investigate certain aspects of the saturation\nmechanism of the dynamo.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 11\n"}
{"prompt": "  The optically invisible infrared-source NGC 2264 IRS 1 is thought to be a\nmassive young stellar object (~10 Msun). Although strong infrared excess\nclearly shows that the central object is surrounded by large amounts of\ncircumstellar material, no information about the spatial distribution of this\ncircumstellar material has been available until now. We used the ESO Very Large\nTelescope Interferometer to perform long-baseline interferometric observations\nof NGC 2264 IRS 1 in the mid-infrared regime. Our observations resolve the\ncircumstellar material around NGC 2264 IRS 1, provide the first direct\nmeasurement of the angular size of the mid-infrared emission, and yield direct\nconstraints on the spatial distribution of the dust. We use different\napproaches (a geometrical model, a temperature-gradient model, and radiative\ntransfer models) to jointly model the observed interferometric visibilities and\nthe spectral energy distribution. The derived visibility values between ~0.02\nand ~0.3 show that the mid-infrared emission is clearly resolved. The\ncharacteristic size of the MIR-emission region is ~30-60 AU; this value is\ntypical for other YSOs with similar or somewhat lower luminosities. A\ncomparison of the sizes for the two position angles shows a significant\nelongation of the dust distribution. Simple spherical envelope models are\ntherefore inconsistent with the data. The radiative transfer modeling of our\ndata suggests that we observe a geometrically thin and optically thick\ncircumstellar disk with a mass of about 0.1 Msun. Our modeling indicates that\nNGC 2264 IRS 1 is surrounded by a flat circumstellar disk that has properties\nsimilar to disks typically found around lower-mass young stellar objects. This\nresult supports the assumption that massive young stellar objects form via\naccretion from circumstellar disks.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 11\n"}
{"prompt": "  The Riemannian Penrose inequality (RPI) bounds from below the ADM mass of\nasymptotically flat manifolds of nonnegative scalar curvature in terms of the\ntotal area of all outermost compact minimal surfaces. The general form of the\nRPI is currently known for manifolds of dimension up to seven. In the present\nwork, we prove a Penrose-like inequality that is valid in all dimensions, for\nconformally flat manifolds. Our inequality treats the area contributions of the\nminimal surfaces in a more favorable way than the RPI, at the expense of using\nthe smaller Euclidean area (rather than the intrinsic area). We give an example\nin which our estimate is sharper than the RPI when many minimal surfaces are\npresent. We do not require the minimal surfaces to be outermost.\n  We also generalize the technique to allow for metrics conformal to a\nscalar-flat (not necessarily Euclidean) background, and prove a Penrose-type\ninequality without an assumption on the sign of scalar curvature. Finally, we\nderive a new lower bound for the ADM mass of a conformally flat, asymptotically\nflat manifold containing any number of zero area singularities.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 11\n"}
{"prompt": "  The quantum hydrodynamic analogy (QHA) equivalent to the Schrodinger equation\nis generalized to its stochastic version by a systematic technique. On large\nscale, the quantum stochastic hydrodynamic analogy (QSHA) shows dynamics that\nunder some circumstances may acquire the classical evolution. The QSHA puts in\nevidence that in presence of spatially distributed noise the quantum\npseudo-potential restores the quantum behavior on a distance shorter than the\ncorrelation length of fluctuations (named here lc) of the quantum wave function\nmodulus. The quantum mechanics is achieved in the deterministic limit when lc\ntends to infinity with respect to the scale of the problem. When the physical\nlength of the problem is of order or larger than lc, the quantum potential may\nhave a finite range of efficacy maintaining the non-local behavior on a\ndistance lL (named here \"quantum non-locality length\") depending both by the\nnoise amplitude and by the inter-particle strength of interaction. In the\ndeterministic limit (quantum mechanics) the model shows that the \"quantum\nnon-locality length\" lLalso becomes infinite. The QSHA unveils that in linear\nsystems fluctuations are not sufficient to break the quantum non-locality\nshowing that lL is infinite even if lc is finite.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 11\n"}
{"prompt": "  Recent advances in nanotechnology have led to the development of\nnano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS) such as nanomechanical resonators, which\nhave recently received significant attention from the scientific community.\nThis has not only been for their capability for the label-free detection of\nbio/chemical-molecules at single-molecule (or atomic) resolution for future\napplications such as the early diagnostics of diseases such as cancer, but also\nfor their unprecedented ability to detect physical quantities such as molecular\nweight, elastic stiffness, surface stress, and surface elastic stiffness for\nadsorbed molecules on the surface. Most experimental works on resonator-based\nmolecular detection have been based on the principle that molecular adsorption\nonto a resonator surface increases the effective mass, and consequently\ndecreases the resonant frequencies of the nanomechanical resonator. However,\nthis principle is insufficient to provide fundamental insights into\nresonator-based molecular detection at the nanoscale; this is due to recently\nproposed novel nanoscale detection principles including various effects such as\nsurface effects, nonlinear oscillations, coupled resonance, and stiffness\neffects. Therefore, our objective in this review is to overview the current\nattempts to understand the underlying mechanisms in nanoresonator-based\ndetection using physical models coupled to computational simulations and/or\nexperiments. Specifically, we will focus on issues of special relevance to the\ndynamic behavior of nanoresonators and their applications in\nbiological/chemical detection. We additionally provide extensive discussion\nregarding potentially fruitful future research directions coupling experiments\nand simulations in order to develop a fundamental understanding of the basic\nphysical principles that govern NEMS and NEMS-based sensing applications.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 11\n"}

{"prompt": "  We consider an online preemptive scheduling problem where jobs with deadlines\narrive sporadically. A commitment requirement is imposed such that the\nscheduler has to either accept or decline a job immediately upon arrival. The\nscheduler's decision to accept an arriving job constitutes a contract with the\ncustomer; if the accepted job is not completed by its deadline as promised, the\nscheduler loses the value of the corresponding job and has to pay an additional\npenalty depending on the amount of unfinished workload. The objective of the\nonline scheduler is to maximize the overall profit, i.e., the total value of\nthe admitted jobs completed before their deadlines less the penalty paid for\nthe admitted jobs that miss their deadlines. We show that the maximum\ncompetitive ratio is $3-2\\sqrt{2}$ and propose a simple online algorithm to\nachieve this competitive ratio. The optimal scheduling includes a threshold\nadmission and a greedy scheduling policies.

{"prompt": "  The second RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) Data Release (DR2) derives log g\nvalues but we present a simpler and cleaner method of identifying dwarfs and\ngiants using only magnitudes, which does not require spectroscopic analysis. We\nconfirm the Bilir et al. (2006) procedure which estimates the number of dwarfs\nand giants via their positions in the J-V two magnitude diagram by applying it\nto RAVE DR2. It is effective in estimating the number of dwarfs and giants at\nJ-H>0.4 compared to RAVE's log g values. For J-H<=0.4, where dwarfs and\nsubgiants show a continuous transition in the J magnitude histogram, we used\nthe Besancon Galaxy model predictions to statistically isolate giants. The\npercentages of giants for red stars and for the whole sample are 85% and 34%,\nrespectively. If we add the subgiants, the percentage of evolved stars for the\nwhole sample raises to 59%. For the first time in the literature, we analysed\nthe effect of CHISQ on RAVE's log g values (CHISQ is the penalised chi^2 from\nRAVE's technique of finding an optimal match between the observed spectrum and\nsynthetic spectra to derive stellar parameters).

{"prompt": "  We introduce two models of biological aggregation, based on randomly moving\nparticles with individual stochasticity depending on the perceived average\npopulation density in their neighbourhood. In the first-order model the\nlocation of each individual is subject to a density-dependent random walk,\nwhile in the second-order model the density-dependent random walk acts on the\nvelocity variable, together with a density-dependent damping term. The main\nnovelty of our models is that we do not assume any explicit aggregative force\nacting on the individuals; instead, aggregation is obtained exclusively by\nreducing the individual stochasticity in response to higher perceived density.\nWe formally derive the corresponding mean-field limits, leading to nonlocal\ndegenerate diffusions. Then, we carry out the mathematical analysis of the\nfirst-order model, in particular, we prove the existence of weak solutions and\nshow that it allows for measure-valued steady states. We also perform linear\nstability analysis and identify conditions for pattern formation. Moreover, we\ndiscuss the role of the nonlocality for well-posedness of the first-order\nmodel.

{"prompt": "  We point out that a non-overlapping well (at negative energies) adjacent to a\nfinite barrier (at positive energies) is a simple potential which is generally\nmissed out while discussing the one-dimensional potentials in the textbooks of\nquantum mechanics. We show that these systems present interesting situations\nwherein transmitivity $(T_b(E))$ of a finite barrier can be changed both\nquantitatively and qualitatively by varying the depth or width of the well or\nby changing the distance between the well and the barrier. Using delta (thin)\nwell near a delta (thin) barrier we show that the well induces energy\noscillations riding over $T_b(E)$ in the transmitivity $T(E)$ at both the\nenergies below and above the barrier. More generally we show that a thick well\nseparated from a thick barrier also gives rise to energy oscillations in\n$T(E)$. A well joining a barrier discontinuously (a finite jump) reduces $T(E)$\n(as compared to $T_b(E))$ over all energies. When the well and barrier are\njoined continuously, $T(E)$ increases and then decreases at energies below the\nbarrier. At energy above the the barrier the changes are inappreciable. In\nthese two cases if we separate the well and the barrier by a distance, $T(E)$\nagain acquires oscillations. Paradoxically, it turns out that a distant well\ninduces more energy oscillations in $T(E)$ than when it is near the barrier.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 11\n"}
{"prompt": "  For each prime p and each embedding of the multiplicative group of an\nalgebraic closure of F_p as complex roots of unity, we construct a p-adic\nindecomposable representation of the integral BC-system as additive\nendomorphisms of the big Witt ring of an algebraic closure of F_p. The obtained\nrepresentations are the p-adic analogues of the complex, extremal KMS states at\nzero temperature of the BC-system. The role of the Riemann zeta function, as\npartition function of the BC-system over complex numbers is replaced, in the\np-adic case, by the p-adic L-functions and the polylogarithms whose values at\nroots of unity encode the KMS states. We use Iwasawa theory to extend the KMS\ntheory to a covering of the completion of an algebraic closure of the p-adic\nfield. We show that our previous work on the hyperring structure of the adeles\nclass space, combines with p-adic analysis to refine the space of valuations on\nthe cyclotomic extension of Q as a noncommutative space intimately related to\nthe integral BC-system and whose arithmetic geometry comes close to fulfill the\nexpectations of the \"arithmetic site\".

{"prompt": "  Superconductivity is observed in a composite of rhombohedral crystalline\nbismuth nanoparticles imbedded in an insulating porous opal host via electrical\ntransport and AC magnetic susceptibility. The onset of superconductivity in\nthis system occurs in two steps, with upper critical temperature Tc,U = 4.1 K\nand lower transition temperature of Tc,L = 0.7 K, which we attribute to the\ngranular nature of the composite. The transition at Tc,U is observed to split\ninto two transitions with the application of a magnetic field, and has upper\ncritical field extrapolated to T = 0 K of Hc2,1(0) = 0.7 T and Hc2,2(0) = 1.0\nT, corresponding to coherence lengths of xi1(0) = 21 nm and xi2(0) = 18 nm,\nrespectively.

{"prompt": "  We investigate the recent suggestion that a Minkowski vacuum is either\nabsolutely stable, or it has a divergent decay rate and thus fails to have a\nlocally Minkowski description.

We carry out the first exploration of what happens\nto the decoupled magnetic flux in 3D, using an MHD version of the ENZO adaptive\nmesh refinement code. The field-matter decoupling is achieved through a sink\nparticle treatment, which is needed to follow the protostellar accretion phase\nof star formation. We find that the accumulation of the decoupled flux near the\naccreting protostar leads to a magnetic pressure buildup. The high pressure is\nreleased anisotropically, along the path of least resistance. It drives a\nlow-density expanding region in which the decoupled magnetic flux is expelled.\nThis decoupling-enabled magnetic structure has never been seen before in 3D MHD\nsimulations of star formation.

In particular, we deal\nwith outage-based quality-of-service constraints, where the probability of each\nuser's SINR not satisfying a service requirement must not fall below a given\noutage probability specification. The study of solution approaches to the\nprobabilistic SINR constrained problem is important because CSI errors are\noften present in practical systems and they may cause substantial SINR outages\nif not handled properly. However, a major technical challenge is how to process\nthe probabilistic SINR constraints. To tackle this, we propose a novel\nrelaxation- restriction (RAR) approach, which consists of two key\ningredients-semidefinite relaxation (SDR), and analytic tools for\nconservatively approximating probabilistic constraints. The underlying goal is\nto establish approximate probabilistic SINR constrained formulations in the\nform of convex conic optimization problems, so that they can be readily\nimplemented by available solvers. Using either an intuitive worst-case argument\nor specialized probabilistic results, we develop various conservative\napproximation schemes for processing probabilistic constraints with quadratic\nuncertainties.

All three models contain\nbound states of nuclei with mass number A <= 4. It is explored to which extent\nthe complex medium effects can be mimicked by the simpler excluded volume\nmodel, regarding the chemical composition and thermodynamic variables.\nFurthermore, the role of heavy nuclei and excited states is investigated by use\nof the excluded volume model. At temperatures of a few MeV the excluded volume\nmodel gives a poor description of the medium effects on the light clusters, but\nthere the composition is actually dominated by heavy nuclei. At larger\ntemperatures there is a rather good agreement, whereas some smaller differences\nand model dependencies remain.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 11\n"}

{"prompt": "  We use cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to investigate how inflows, star\nformation, and outflows govern the the gaseous and metal content of galaxies.\nIn our simulations, galaxy metallicities are established by a balance between\ninflows and outflows as governed by the mass outflow rate, implying that the\nmass-metallicity relation reflects how the outflow rate varies with stellar\nmass (M*). Gas content is set by a competition between inflow into and gas\nconsumption within the ISM, the latter being governed by the SF law, while the\nformer is impacted by both wind recycling and preventive feedback. Stochastic\nvariations in the inflow rate move galaxies off the equilibrium M*-Z and\nZ*-fgas relations in a manner correlated with star formation rate, and the\nscatter is set by the timescale to re-equilibrate. The evolution of both\nrelations from z=3-0 is slow, as individual galaxies tend to evolve mostly\nalong the relations. Gas fractions at a given M* slowly decrease with time\nbecause the cosmic inflow rate diminishes faster than the consumption rate,\nwhile metallicities slowly increase as infalling gas becomes more enriched.\nObservations from z~3-0 are better matched by simulations employing\nmomentum-driven wind scalings rather than constant wind speeds, but all models\npredict too low gas fractions at low masses and too high metallicities at high\nM*. All our models reproduce observed second-parameter trends of the\nmass-metallicity relation with star formation rate and environment, indicating\nthat these are a consequence of equilibrium and not feedback. Overall, the\nanalytical framework of our equilibrium scenario broadly captures the relevant\nphysics establishing the galaxy gas and metal content in simulations, which\nsuggests that the cycle of baryonic inflows and outflows centrally governs the\ncosmic evolution of these properties in typical star-forming galaxies.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 11\n"}

To this end, the SLPs are locally decompressed and\nthen recompressed in a uniform way.\n  This technique yields an O((n+m)log M) algorithm for compressed pattern\nmatching, assuming that M fits in O(1) machine words, where n (m) is the size\nof the compressed representation of the text (pattern, respectively), while M\nis the size of the decompressed pattern. If only m+n fits in O(1) machine\nwords, the running time increases to O((n+m)log M log(n+m)). The previous best\nalgorithm due to Lifshits had O(n^2m) running time.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 11\n"}

{"prompt": "  Symbolic execution is a successful and very popular technique used in\nsoftware verification and testing. A key limitation of symbolic execution is in\ndealing with code containing loops. The problem is that even a single loop can\ngenerate a huge number of different symbolic execution paths, corresponding to\ndifferent number of loop iterations and taking various paths through the loop.\n  We introduce a technique which, given a start location above some loops and a\ntarget location anywhere below these loops, returns a feasible path between\nthese two locations, if such a path exists. The technique infers a collection\nof constraint systems from the program and uses them to steer the symbolic\nexecution towards the target. On reaching a loop it iteratively solves the\nappropriate constraint system to find out which path through this loop to take,\nor, alternatively, whether to continue below the loop. To construct the\nconstraint systems we express the values of variables modified in a loop as\nfunctions of the number of times a given path through the loop was executed.\n  We have built a prototype implementation of our technique and compared it to\nstate-of-the-art symbolic execution tools on simple programs with loops. The\nresults show significant improvements in the running time. We found instances\nwhere our algorithm finished in seconds, whereas the other tools did not finish\nwithin an hour.

It is of particular importance to know how\nthese two effects, i.e. the non-trivial topology of electronic states and\nRashba spin splitting, interplay with each other. Here we show, through\nsophisticated first-principles calculations, that BiTeI, a giant bulk Rashba\nsemiconductor, turns into a topological insulator under a reasonable pressure.\nThis material is shown to exhibit several unique features such as, a highly\npressure-tunable giant Rashba spin splitting, an unusual pressure-induced\nquantum phase transition, and more importantly the formation of strikingly\ndifferent Dirac surface states at opposite sides of the material.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 11\n"}

In the circumstellar disk, fragmentation first occurs due to\ngravitational instability in a magnetically inactive region, and\nsubstellar-mass objects appear. The substellar-mass objects lose their orbital\nangular momenta by gravitational interaction with the massive circumstellar\ndisk and finally fall onto the protostar. After this fall, the circumstellar\ndisk increases its mass by mass accretion and again induces fragmentation. The\nformation and falling of substellar-mass objects are repeated in the\ncircumstellar disk until the end of the main accretion phase. In this process,\nthe mass of fragments remain small, because the circumstellar disk loses its\nmass by fragmentation and subsequent falling of fragments before it becomes\nvery massive. In addition, when fragments orbit near the protostar, they\ndisturb the inner disk region and promote mass accretion onto the protostar.\nThe orbital motion of substellar-mass objects clearly synchronizes with the\ntime variation of the accretion luminosity of the protostar. Moreover, as the\nobjects fall, the protostar shows a strong brightening for a short duration.\nThe intermittent protostellar outflows are also driven by the circumstellar\ndisk whose magnetic field lines are highly tangled owing to the orbital motion\nof fragments.

This allows\nus to construct an ergodic equilibrium state with a weak Gibbs property, which\nwe then use to prove uniqueness.

J., 675, 899 (2008)]. Our numerical work has now been\nextended to 3D by means of large-scale numerical simulations. Random\nphotospheric footpoint motion is applied for a time much longer than the\ncorrelation time of the motion to obtain converged average coronal heating\nrates. Simulations are done for different values of the Lundquist number to\ndetermine scaling. In the high-Lundquist number limit, the coronal heating rate\nobtained so far is consistent with a trend that is independent of the Lundquist\nnumber, as predicted by previous analysis as well as 2D simulations. In the\nsame limit the average magnetic energy built up by the random footpoint motion\ntends to have a much weaker dependence on the Lundquist number than that in the\n2D simulations, due to the formation of strong current layers and subsequent\ndisruption when the equilibrium becomes unstable.

{"prompt": "  The performance of standard stochastic approximation implementations can vary\nsignificantly based on the choice of the steplength sequence, and in general,\nlittle guidance is provided about good choices. Motivated by this gap, in the\nfirst part of the paper, we present two adaptive steplength schemes for\nstrongly convex differentiable stochastic optimization problems, equipped with\nconvergence theory. The first scheme, referred to as a recursive steplength\nstochastic approximation scheme, optimizes the error bounds to derive a rule\nthat expresses the steplength at a given iteration as a simple function of the\nsteplength at the previous iteration and certain problem parameters. This rule\nis seen to lead to the optimal steplength sequence over a prescribed set of\nchoices. The second scheme, termed as a cascading steplength stochastic\napproximation scheme, maintains the steplength sequence as a piecewise-constant\ndecreasing function with the reduction in the steplength occurring when a\nsuitable error threshold is met. In the second part of the paper, we allow for\nnondifferentiable objective and we propose a local smoothing technique that\nleads to a differentiable approximation of the function. Assuming a uniform\ndistribution on the local randomness, we establish a Lipschitzian property for\nthe gradient of the approximation and prove that the obtained Lipschitz bound\ngrows at a modest rate with problem size. This facilitates the development of\nan adaptive steplength stochastic approximation framework, which now requires\nsampling in the product space of the original measure and the artificially\nintroduced distribution. The resulting adaptive steplength schemes are applied\nto three stochastic optimization problems. We observe that both schemes perform\nwell in practice and display markedly less reliance on user-defined parameters.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 11\n"}

Yet, because it is difficult to directly\nmeasure mechanical stress {\\it in vivo} on sub-cellular scale, little is\nunderstood about the role of mechanics of development.

The state of each arm evolves as a\nfinite-state Markov chain with unknown parameters. At each time slot, the\nplayer can select K < N arms to play and receives state-dependent rewards\n(corresponding to the throughput obtained given the activity of primary users).\nThe objective is to maximize the expected total rewards (i.e., total\nthroughput) obtained over multiple plays. The performance of an algorithm for\nsuch a multi-armed bandit problem is measured in terms of regret, defined as\nthe difference in expected reward compared to a model-aware genie who always\nplays the best K arms. In this paper, we propose a new continuous exploration\nand exploitation (CEE) algorithm for this problem. When no information is\navailable about the dynamics of the arms, CEE is the first algorithm to\nguarantee near-logarithmic regret uniformly over time. When some bounds\ncorresponding to the stationary state distributions and the state-dependent\nrewards are known, we show that CEE can be easily modified to achieve\nlogarithmic regret over time.

Existing SAURON data\n(R < 13\"), and globular cluster kinematic data covering 145\" < R < 540\"\ncomplete the kinematic coverage to R = 47 kpc. At this radial distance the\nlogarithmic dark halo comprises 85.3 (+2.5,-2.4) % of the total enclosed mass\nof 5.7^(+1.3)_(-0.9) X 10^(12) M_sun making M87 one of the most massive\ngalaxies in the local universe. Our best-fit logarithmic dynamical models\nreturn a stellar mass-to-light ratio of 9.1^(+0.2)_(-0.2) (V-band), a dark halo\ncircular velocity of 800^(+75)_(-25) kms, and a dark halo scale radius of\n36^(+7)_(-3) kpc. The stellar M/L, assuming an NFW dark halo, is well\nconstrained to 8.20^(+0.05)_(-0.10) (V-band). The stars in M87 are found to be\nradially anisotropic out to R ~ 0.5 R_e then isotropic or slightly tangentially\nanisotropic to our last stellar data point at R = 2.4 R_e where the anisotropy\nof the stars and globular clusters are in excellent agreement. The globular\nclusters then become radially anisotropic in the last two modeling bins at R =\n3.4 R_e and R = 4.8 R_e. As one of the most massive galaxies in the local\nuniverse, constraints on both the mass distribution of M87 and anisotropy of\nits kinematic components strongly informs our theories of early-type galaxy\nformation and evolution in dense environments.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 11\n"}
{"prompt": "  The existence of a correlation between observed radio spectral index (alpha)\nand redshift (z) has long been used as a method for locating high-z radio\ngalaxies. We use 9 highly spectroscopically complete radio samples, selected at\ndifferent frequencies and flux limits, to determine the efficiency of this\nmethod, and compare consistently observed correlations between alpha,\nluminosity, linear size, and redshift. We observe a weak correlation between z\nand alpha which remains even when Malmquist bias is removed. The strength of\nthis correlation depends on both the k-correction and sample selection\nfrequency, in addition to the frequency at which alpha is measured, and\nconsistent results for both high and low frequency selected samples are only\nseen if analysis is restricted to just extended radio galaxies. Many of the\nhighest redshift radio galaxies are very compact and often display a negatively\ncurved or peaked spectrum, and therefore the low-frequency radio spectrum as a\nwhole should be studied; this is something for which the LOFAR will be crucial.\nWe quantify both the efficiency and the completeness of various techniques used\nto select high-z radio galaxies. A steep-spectrum cut applied to low-frequency\nselected samples can more than double the fraction of high-z sources, but at a\ncost of excluding over half of the high-z sources present in the original\nsample. An angular size cut is an almost as equally effective method as a\nsteep-spectrum cut, and works for both high and low frequency selected samples.\nIn multi-wavelength data, selection first of infrared-faint radio sources\nremains by far the most efficient method of selecting high-z sources.

The\ntotal effective area of the detector will be 100 square kilometres. A large\ninter-station distance of 150 metres and a simple and inexpensive station\ndesign will make the instrumentation of such a large area feasible.

The threshold for\ngamma-rays is 44 TeV (50% trigger efficiency) in the standard configuration,\nand the minimal detectable flux from a point source is below 10^(-13) erg / (s\ncm^2) above 100 TeV. Several options to lower the energy threshold of the\ndetector have been examined. The threshold is decreased to 34 TeV by a smaller\nstation spacing of 100 metres, and is further decreased to 24 TeV if the\ndetector is set up at an altitude of 2000 metres above sea level. At a spacing\nof 150 metres, however, a higher altitude has no positive effect on the energy\nthreshold. The threshold can also be reduced if the detector stations consist\nof small, independent 2 x 2 sub-arrays.

The main goal of the present work is to study this recent torque reversal\nthat occurred in 2008 February.\n  Methods. We present a spectral analysis of this source using two pointed\nobservations performed by Suzaku in 2006 March and in 2010 September.\n  Results. We confirm with Suzaku the presence of a strong emission-line\ncomplex centered on 1 keV, with the strongest line being the hydrogen-like Ne\nLy-alpha at 1.025(3) keV. We were able to resolve this complex with up to seven\nemission lines. A dramatic increase of the intensity of the Ne Ly-alpha line\nafter the 2008 torque reversal occurred, with the equivalent width of this line\nreaching almost the same value measured by ASCA in 1993. We also report on the\ndetection of a cyclotron line feature centered at ~37 keV. In spite of the fact\nthat an increase of the X-ray luminosity (0.5-100 keV) of a factor of ~2.8\noccurred between these two observations, no significant change in the energy of\nthe cyclotron line feature was observed. However, the intensity of the ~1 keV\nline complex increased by an overall factor of ~8.\n  Conclusions.

HO is able to support superconductivity at lower temperatures (Tc ~ 1.5\nK), and when magnetism is developed with increasing pressure both the HO and\nthe superconductivity are destroyed. Other ways of probing the HO are via\nRh-doping and very large magnetic fields. During the last few years a variety\nof advanced techniques have been tested to probe the HO state and their\nattempts will be summarized. A digest of recent theoretical developments is\nalso included. It is the objective of this Colloquium to shed additional light\non the HO state and its associated phases in other materials.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 11\n"}

In our model, each link has unit\nprice and each agent tries to minimize its cost, which is either its local\ndiameter or its total distance to other players in the (undirected) underlying\ngraph of the created network. Two versions of the game are studied: in the MAX\nversion, the cost incurred to a vertex is the maximum distance between the\nvertex and other vertices, and in the SUM version, the cost incurred to a\nvertex is the sum of distances between the vertex and other vertices. We prove\nthat in both versions pure Nash equilibria exist, but the problem of finding\nthe best response of a vertex is NP-hard. We take the social cost of the\ncreated network to be its diameter, and next we study the maximum possible\ndiameter of an equilibrium graph with n vertices in various cases. When the sum\nof players' budgets is n-1, the equilibrium graphs are always trees, and we\nprove that their maximum diameter is Theta(n) and Theta(log n) in MAX and SUM\nversions, respectively. When each vertex has unit budget (i.e. can establish\nlink to just one vertex), the diameter of any equilibrium graph in either\nversion is Theta(1). We give examples of equilibrium graphs in the MAX version,\nsuch that all vertices have positive budgets and yet the diameter is\nOmega(sqrt(log n)).

The aspect (diameter to thickness) ratio is taken to be very high,\nin order to model solutions of mineral platelets recently explored\nexperimentally. In this regime a high degree of orientational ordering occurs;\ntherefore the model platelets can be taken as completely parallel and are\namenable to analysis via a fundamental-measure theory. Our focus is on the\nnematic vs. smectic phase interplay, since a high degree of polydispersity in\ndiameter suppresses the formation of the columnar phase. When interactions are\npurely hard, the theory predicts a continuous nematic-to-smectic transition,\nregardless of the degree of diameter polydispersity. However, polydispersity\nenhances the stability of the smectic phase against the nematic phase.\nPredictions for the case where an additional soft interaction is added are\nobtained using mean-field perturbation theory. In the case of the one-component\nfluid, the transition remains continuous for repulsive forces, and the smectic\nphase becomes more stable as the range of the interaction is decreased.

Here I will show how the hypersonic shocks\nare at the origin of helium line formation and connected with the helium\nemission and line doubling detected by Preston (2009, 2011).\n  I will present new neutral and single ionized helium line data in the\nhypersonic Blazhko star S Arae. The He II appears as a weak emission and its\norigin is strongly connected with the hypersonic shock in S Arae. The shock is\nextremely strong and can reach a Mach number >30. The HeI lines first appear in\nemission, over ~2% of the pulsation period, followed by the HeI absorption\ndoubling phenomenon occurring simultaneously with the neutral metallic\nabsorption line phenomenon over ~8% of the pulsation period.\n  Despite several claimed detections of magnetic fields in RR Lyrae, Preston\n(1967) found none after two years of observations. This is consistent with my\nrecent spectro-polarimetric measurements (2004), over four years, concluding\nthat RR Lyr is a bona fide nonmagnetic star, leading to the falsification of\nall the models of the Blazhko effect requiring strong photospheric magnetic\nfields.

Assuming the dynamical equilibrium,\nwe estimated a virial mass of M ~ 10^{15} h_{70} M_{\\odot}. No evidence of\nsubstructure was found within 1.4 Mpc radius. We found a statistically\nsignificant departure from Gaussianity of the group members velocities in the\nmost external regions of the group.

We also found\nthat the photometrical luminosity function is bimodal, showing a lack of M_{r}\n~ -19.5 galaxies. The brightest group galaxy shows low Sersic parameter (n~2)\nand a small peculiar velocity.

We collected all available\nrelevant archived observations supplemented with our new measurements of these\nstars and analysed the period variations of the stars using a novel method that\nallows for the combination of data of diverse sorts. We found that the shapes\nof their phase curves were constant, while the periods were changing. Both\nstars exhibit alternating intervals of rotational braking and acceleration. The\nrotation period of CU Vir was gradually shortening until the year 1968, when it\nreached its local minimum of 0.52067198 d. The period then started increasing,\nreaching its local maximum of 0.5207163 d in the year 2005. Since that time the\nrotation has begun to accelerate again. We also found much smaller period\nchanges in CU Vir on a timescale of several years. The rotation period of V901\nOri was increasing for the past quarter-century, reaching a maximum of 1.538771\nd in the year 2003, when the rotation period began to decrease. A theoretically\nunexpected alternating variability of rotation periods in these stars would\nremove the spin-down time paradox and brings a new insight into structure and\nevolution of magnetic upper-main-sequence stars.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 11\n"}

The input\nbuffer of each node is modeled as a Geo/G/1 queue, and the packet service time\ndistribution is derived from Markov state space of 802.11 DCF with the\nunderlying scheduling algorithm. The DCF defines two access mechanisms, namely\nthe Basic access mechanism and the request-to-send/clear-to-send (RTS/CTS)\naccess mechanism.

We present optical-to-radio spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) of the five SCUBA sources. The emission of RXJ0941 is dominated by\nreprocessed AGN emission in the observed MIR range, while the starburst\ncontribution completely dominates in the submm range. The SEDs of the other\nthree counterparts are compatible with a dominant starburst contribution above\n~24um, with star formation rates SFR~2000Msun/yr, central dust masses\nlog(Mdust/Msun)~9+-0.5 and hence central gas masses log(Mgas/Msun)~10.7. There\nis very little room for an AGN contribution. From X-ray upper limits and the\nobserved 24um flux, we derive a maximum 2-10keV X-ray luminosity of 1e44 erg/s\nfor any putative AGN, even if they are heavily obscured. This in turn points to\nrelatively small black holes with log(MBH/Msun)<~8 and hence stellar-to-black\nhole mass ratios about one order of magnitude higher than those observed in the\npresent Universe: most of their central black hole masses are still to be\naccreted. Local stellar-to-black hole masses ratios can be reached if ~1.3% of\nthe available nuclear gas mass is accreted.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 11\n"}

This is observed both when varying the repetition rate and when\nadding Krypton 85, though side branches are longer with the radioactive\nadmixture. But velocities and minimal diameters of streamers are virtually\nindependent of the background ionization level. In air, the inception cloud\nbreaks up into streamers at a smaller radius when the repetition rate and\ntherefore the background ionization level is higher. When measuring the effects\nof the pulse repetition rate and of the radioactive admixture on the discharge\nmorphology, we found that our estimates of background ionization levels are\nconsistent with these observations; this gives confidence in the estimates.\n  Streamer channels generally do not follow the paths of previous discharge\nchannels for repetition rates of up to 10 Hz.

Each switching path is coupled to a different\nreorientation of the BiFeO3 unit cell, and hence different coupling to the\nmagnetic order as well as different magnitudes of switchable polarization. A\ndegradation of the ferroelectric properties of BiFeO3 will result in losing\ncontrollability of magnetic order switching in magnetoelectric devices and\ncapacity for information storage in ferroelectric memory devices.

{"prompt": "  Context: The interaction of plasma motions and magnetic fields is an\nimportant mechanism, which drives solar activity in all its facets. For\nexample, photospheric flows are responsible for the advection of magnetic flux,\nthe redistribution of flux during the decay of sunspots, and the built-up of\nmagnetic shear in flaring active regions. Aims: Systematic studies based on\nG-band data from the Japanese Hinode mission provide the means to gather\nstatistical properties of horizontal flow fields. This facilitates comparative\nstudies of solar features, e.g., G-band bright points, magnetic knots, pores,\nand sunspots at various stages of evolution and in distinct magnetic\nenvironments, thus, enhancing our understanding of the dynamic Sun. Methods: We\nadapted Local Correlation Tracking (LCT) to measure horizontal flow fields\nbased on G-band images obtained with the Solar Optical Telescope on board\nHinode. In total about 200 time-series with a duration between 1-16 h and a\ncadence between 15-90 s were analyzed. Selecting both a high-cadence (dt = 15\ns) and a long-duration (dT = 16 h) time-series enabled us to optimize and\nvalidate the LCT input parameters, hence, ensuring a robust, reliable, uniform,\nand accurate processing of a huge data volume. Results: The LCT algorithm\nproduces best results for G-band images having a cadence of 60-90 s. If the\ncadence is lower, the velocity of slowly moving features will not be reliably\ndetected. If the cadence is higher, the scene on the Sun will have evolved too\nmuch to bear any resemblance with the earlier situation. Consequently, in both\ninstances horizontal proper motions are underestimated.

{"prompt": "  Most methodologies for modeling Transmission Line (TL) based channels define\nthe input-output relationship in the frequency domain (FD) and handle the TL\nresorting to a two-port network (2PN) formalism. These techniques have not yet\nbeen formally mapped into a discrete-time (DT) block model, which is useful to\nsimulate and estimate the channel response as well as to design optimal\nprecoding strategies. TL methods also fall short when they are applied to Time\nVarying (TV) systems, such as the power line channel. The objective of this\npaper is to establish if and how one can introduce a DT block model for the\nPower Line Channel. We prove that it is possible to use Lifting and Trailing\nZeros (L&TZ) techniques to derive a DT block model that maps the TL-based\ninput-output description directly in the time domain (TD) block channel model.\nMore specifically, we find an interesting relationship between the elements of\nan ABCD matrix, defined in the FD, and filtering kernels that allow an elegant\nrepresentation of the channel in the TD. The same formalism is valid for both\nthe Linear Time Invariant (LTI) and the Linear TV (LTV) cases, and bridges\ncommunications and signal processing methodologies with circuits and systems\nanalysis tools.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 11\n"}

{"prompt": "  The physical mechanism underlying scattering properties of matter wave\ngap-solitons by linear optical lattice defects is investigated. The occurrence\nof repeated reflection, transmission and trapping regions for increasing\nstrengths of an optical lattice defect are shown to be due to impurity modes\ninside the defect potential with chemical potentials and numbers of atoms\nmatching corresponding quantities of an incoming gap-soliton. For gap-solitons\nwith chemical potentials very close to band edges, the number of resonances\nobserved in the scattering coincides with the number of bound states which can\nexist in the defect potential for the given defect strength. The dependence of\nthe positions and widths of the transmission resonant on the incoming\ngap-soliton velocities are investigated by means of a defect mode analysis and\neffective mass theory. The comparisons with direct integrations of the\nGross-Pitaevskii equation provide a very good agreement confirming the\ncorrectness of our interpretation. The possibility of multiple resonant\ntransmission through arrays of optical lattice defects is also demonstrated.

It is explained\nhow the emergence of scale invariance connects UV divergences to IR\nsingularities, and the RG equation is employed to compute the critical\nexponents for the O(n)-symmetric Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson theory. The second part\nis devoted to field theory representations of non-linear stochastic dynamical\nsystems, and the application of RG tools to critical dynamics. Dynamic critical\nphenomena in systems near equilibrium are efficiently captured through Langevin\nequations, and their mapping onto the Janssen-De Dominicis response functional,\nexemplified by the purely relaxational models with non-conserved (model A) /\nconserved order parameter (model B).

{"prompt": "  We present an analysis of the spectral properties observed in X-rays from\nNeutron Star X-ray binary 4U~1728-34 during transitions between the low and the\nhigh luminosity states when electron temperature kT_e of the Compton cloud\nmonotonically decreases from 15 to 2.5 keV. We analyze the transition episodes\nfrom this source observed with BeppoSAX and RXTE. We find that the X-ray\nbroad-band energy spectra of 4U~1728-34 during all spectral states can be\nmodeled by a combination of a thermal (black body-like) component, a\nComptonized component (which we herein denote COMPTB) and a Gaussian component.\nSpectral analysis using this model evidences that the photon power-law index\nGamma is almost constant (Gamma=1.99+/-0.02) when kT_e changes from 15 to 2.5\nkeV during these spectral transitions. We explain this quasi-stability of the\nindex by the model in which the spectrum is dominated by the strong thermal\nComptonized component formed in the transition layer (TL) between the accretion\ndisk and neutron star surface. The index quasi-stability takes place when the\nenergy release in the TL is much higher than the flux coming to the TL from the\naccretion disk. This intrinsic property of neutron star is fundamentally\ndifferent from that in black hole binary sources for which the index\nmonotonically increases during spectral transition from the low state to high\nstate and saturates at high values of mass accretion rate.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 11\n"}

Following previous\nwork where the dust size distribution has been calculated from a state-of-the\nart collision model for dust aggregates that involves both coagulation and\nfragmentation (Paper I), the corresponding opacities are presented in this\nstudy. The opacities are calculated by applying the effective medium theory\nassuming that the dust aggregates are a mix of 0.1{\\mu}m silicate and graphite\ngrains and vacuum. In particular, we explore how the coagulation affects the\nnear-IR opacities and the opacity in the 9.7{\\mu}m silicate feature. We find\nthat as dust aggregates grow to {\\mu}m-sizes both the near-IR color excess and\nthe opacity in the 9.7 {\\mu}m feature increases. Despite their coagulation,\nporous aggregates help to prolong the presence of the 9.7{\\mu}m feature. We\nfind that the ratio between the opacity in the silicate feature and the near-IR\ncolor excess becomes lower with respect to the ISM, in accordance with many\nobservations of dark clouds. However, this trend is primarily a result of ice\nmantle formation and the mixed material composition of the aggregates, rather\nthan being driven by coagulation.

{"prompt": "  Most biological processes are described as a series of interactions between\nproteins and other molecules, and interactions are in turn described in terms\nof atomic structures. To annotate protein functions as sets of interaction\nstates at atomic resolution, and thereby to better understand the relation\nbetween protein interactions and biological functions, we conducted exhaustive\nall-against-all atomic structure comparisons of all known binding sites for\nligands including small molecules, proteins and nucleic acids, and identified\nrecurring elementary motifs. By integrating the elementary motifs associated\nwith each subunit, we defined composite motifs which represent\ncontext-dependent combinations of elementary motifs. It is demonstrated that\nfunction similarity can be better inferred from composite motif similarity\ncompared to the similarity of protein sequences or of individual binding sites.\nBy integrating the composite motifs associated with each protein function, we\ndefine meta-composite motifs each of which is regarded as a time-independent\ndiagrammatic representation of a biological process. It is shown that\nmeta-composite motifs provide richer annotations of biological processes than\nsequence clusters. The present results serve as a basis for bridging atomic\nstructures to higher-order biological phenomena by classification and\nintegration of binding site structures.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 11\n"}

{"prompt": "  The BaBar Collaboration has recently reported products of branching fractions\nthat include $B$ meson semileptonic decays into final states with charged and\nneutral $D_{1}(2420)$ and $D_{2}^{\\ast}(2460)$, two narrow orbitally excited\ncharmed mesons. We evaluate these branching fractions, together with those\nconcerning $D_{0}^{\\ast}(2400)$ and $D_{1}'(2430)$ mesons, within the framework\nof a constituent quark model. The calculation is performed in two steps, one of\nwhich involves a semileptonic decay and the other is mediated by a strong\nprocess. Our results are in agreement with the experimental data. We also\nextend the study to semileptonic decays of $B_{s}$ into orbitally excited\ncharmed-strange mesons, providing predictions to the possible measurements to\nbe carried out at LHC.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 11\n"}

{"prompt": "  In interacting binaries, comparison of a donor star's radial response to mass\nloss with the response of its Roche radius determines whether mass loss\npersists and, if so, determines the timescale and stability of the ensuing\nevolutionary phase. For giants with deep convective envelopes, the canonical\ndescription holds that once mass transfer begins it typically proceeds\ncatastrophically on the dynamical timescale, as the star cannot lose sufficient\nheat in order to avoid expansion. However, we demonstrate that the local\nthermal timescale of the envelope's superadiabatic outer surface layer remains\ncomparable to that of mass loss in most cases of \"dynamical\" mass loss. We\nargue therefore that if mass loss proceeds on a timescale longer than this,\nthen even a deep convective envelope will not dramatically expand, as the\nsurface layer will have time to relax thermally and reconstitute itself. We\ndemonstrate that in general the polytropic approximation gives much too strict\na criterion for stability, and discuss the dependence of the donor's response\non its radius in addition to its core mass. In general, we find that the\neffective response of the donor on rapid timescales cannot be determined\naccurately without detailed evolutionary calculations.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 11\n"}
{"prompt": "  Gravitation governs the expansion and fate of the universe, and the growth of\nlarge scale structure within it, but has not been tested in detail on these\ncosmic scales. The observed acceleration of the expansion may provide signs of\ngravitational laws beyond general relativity. Since the form of any such\nextension is not clear, from either theory or data, we adopt a model\nindependent approach to parametrising deviations to the Einstein framework. We\nexplore the phase space dynamics of two key post-GR functions and derive a\nclassification scheme and an absolute criterion on accuracy necessary for\ndistinguishing classes of gravity models. Future surveys will be able to\nconstrain the post-GR functions' amplitudes and forms to the required\nprecision, and hence reveal new aspects of gravitation.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 11\n"}
{"prompt": "  This paper proposes a new distance metric between clusterings that\nincorporates information about the spatial distribution of points and clusters.\nOur approach builds on the idea of a Hilbert space-based representation of\nclusters as a combination of the representations of their constituent points.\nWe use this representation and the underlying metric to design a\nspatially-aware consensus clustering procedure. This consensus procedure is\nimplemented via a novel reduction to Euclidean clustering, and is both simple\nand efficient. All of our results apply to both soft and hard clusterings. We\naccompany these algorithms with a detailed experimental evaluation that\ndemonstrates the efficiency and quality of our techniques.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 11\n"}

{"prompt": "  We calculate the renormalisation of different light ray operators with one\nlight degree of freedom and a static heavy quark. Both $2\\to2$- and\n$2\\to3$-kernels are considered. A comparison with the light-light case suggests\nthat the mixing with three-particle operators is solely governed by the light\ndegrees of freedom. Additionally we show that conformal symmetry is already\nbroken at the level of the one loop counterterms due to the additional\nUV-renormalisation of a cusp in the two contributing Wilson-lines. This general\nfeature can be used to fix the $2\\to2$-renormalisation kernels up to a\nconstant. Some examples for applications of our results are given.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 11\n"}

The data together with the fits\nconfirm that while the local density of states around the Dirac point of the\nelectronic spectrum at the surface is significantly disrupted near the impurity\nby the creation of low-energy resonance state, the Dirac point is not locally\ndestroyed.
