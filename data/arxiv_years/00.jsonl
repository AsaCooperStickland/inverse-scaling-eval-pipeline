Also, BH mass scales with bulge mass;\nthe median BH mass fraction is 0.15 % of the bulge mass. In contrast, BH mass\ndoes not scale with disk properties. Pure disk galaxies - ones that lack a\nbulge component - must have BH mass fractions that are much smaller than the BH\nmass fractions in bulges.

For instance, every zonoid (the range of a\nnonatomic vector-valued measure) is LNC (Corollary 34). However, there are no\ninfinite-dimensional compact LNC sets (Theorem 23).\n  The LNC concept originated in a search for continuous sections, and the\npresent paper shows how it leads naturally (and constructively) to continuous\nsections in a variety of situations. Let Q be a compact, convex set in R^n, and\nlet T be a linear map from R^n into R^m. We show (Theorem 1) that Q is LNC if\nand only if the restriction of any such T to Q is an open map of Q onto T(Q).\nThis implies that if Q is LNC, then any such T has continuous sections (i.e.\nthere are continuous right inverses of T) that map from T(Q) to Q, and in fact\nit is possible to define continuous sections constructively in various natural\nways (Theorem 3, Corollary 4, and Theorem 5).

The first one (E) corresponds to the asymptotic energy at\nlarge $|z|$, while the second one (D) specifies the value of z at the\nsingularity which characterizes such models. The E=D=0 solution is just the\nflat Friedmann model. The 1-parameter family of solutions with z>0 and D=0 are\ninhomogeneous cosmological models which expand from a Big Bang singularity at\nt=0 and are asymptotically Friedmann at large z; models with E>0 are everywhere\nunderdense relative to Friedmann and expand forever, while those with E<0 are\neverywhere overdense and recollapse to a black hole containing another\nsingularity. The black hole always has an apparent horizon but need not have an\nevent horizon. The D=0 solutions with z<0 are just the time reverse of the z>0\nones. The 2-parameter solutions with D>0 again represent inhomogeneous\ncosmological models but the Big Bang singularity is at $z=-1/D$, the Big Crunch\nsingularity is at $z=+1/D$, and any particular solution necessarily spans both\nz<0 and z>0.

The observed ERE intensity from NGC 2023 then gives a lower\nbound on the required photoluminescence efficiency eta.

This will\nthen produce the period of near-constant X-ray emission seen in this system.\nThis scenario can also explain the observed anti-correlation between the\noptical and X-ray fluxes. It is generally accepted that optical emission in\nlow-mass X-ray binaries is produced by irradiation of the outer disc by X-rays.\nThere is also strong circumstantial evidence that in order for the outer disc\nto see the irradiating flux, it must be warped. Depending on the warp\npropagation mechanism, either a burst of mass from the secondary or viscous\ndecay are likely to decrease the degree of warping, thereby causing the\ndecrease in the observed optical flux while the X-ray flux remains constant or\neven increases, exactly as observed in GRO J1655-40.

{"prompt": "  Referring to a conception put forward by Stuart Kauffman in his\n\"Investigations\", it is shown how the onset of classicity can be visualized in\nterms of an emergent process originating in entangled ensemble states of\nknotted spin networks. The latter exhibit a suitable autocatalytic behaviour\neffectively producing knots by knots acting upon other knots. In particular, a\nquantum computational structure can be described underlying spin networks such\nthat most conditions for a partial ordering are not more valid for the latter.\nA concep- tual argument is given then indicating that on a fundamental level,\nphysics is non-local and a-temporal, and hence does not admit of the concept of\ncausality. Hence, modelling the emergence of classicity in terms of a\npercolating web of coherence eventually decohering (in using a cellular\nautomata architecture) does not imply the necessity of visualizing histories of\ndirected percolation as causal sets. These aspects are compatible though with\nthe recent concept of spin foams which do not actually imply distinguished\ndirections of time flow on the micro-level.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 00\n"}

Vassilev, Conservation Laws and Group-Invariant\nSolutions of the von Karman Equations, Int. J. Nonlinear Mech. 31 (1), pp.\n73-87, (1986)]. Two of these balance laws correspond to the time-dependent von\nKarman equations themselves. They are used to define acceleration waves in thin\nisotropic elastic plates as discontinuity solutions with finite jumps of second\nderivatives of the displacement field at a certain curve - the wave front.\nThese two balance laws lead through Hadamard's lemma and Kotchin's theorem to a\nset of jump conditions on the wave front. Similarly, the other balance laws\nlead to additional and independent jump conditions on the curve of\ndiscontinuity. Several examples are given to illustrate the effect of involving\njump conditions of that kind in analysis of acceleration waves in plates. The\nexamples are composed on the basis of three families of group-invariant\nsolutions to the time-dependent von Karman equations. They present three kinds\nof waveforms pertaining to the class of the so-called relatively undistorded\nprogressive waves.

{"prompt": "  The standard cold dark matter (CDM) model has recently been challenged by the\nclaim that dwarf galaxies have dark matter halos with constant density cores.\nConsequently, numerous alternative dark matter candidates have recently been\nproposed. In this paper, we scrutinize the observational evidence for the\nincongruity between dwarf galaxies and the CDM model. To this end, we analyze\nthe rotation curves of 20 late-type dwarf galaxies studied by Swaters (1999).\nTaking the effects of beam-smearing and adiabatic contraction into account, we\nfit mass models to these rotation curves with dark matter halos with different\ncusp slopes, ranging from constant density cores to r^{-2} cusps. Uncertainties\nin the stellar mass-to-light ratio and the limited spatial sampling of the\nhalo's density distribution hamper a unique mass decomposition. Consequently,\nthe rotation curves in our sample cannot be used to discriminate between dark\nhalos with constant density cores and r^{-1} cusps. We show that the dwarf\ngalaxies analyzed here are consistent with cold dark matter halos in a LCDM\ncosmology, and that there is thus no need to abandon the idea that dark matter\nis cold and collisionless. However, the data is also consistent with any\nalternative dark matter model that produces dark matter halos with central\ncusps less steep than r^{-1.5}. In fact, we argue that based on existing\nrotation curves alone at best weak limits can be obtained on cosmological\nparameters and/or the nature of the dark matter.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 00\n"}

{"prompt": "  We discuss geometry underlying orientifolds with non-trivial NS-NS B-flux. If\nD-branes wrap a torus with B-flux the rank of the gauge group is reduced due to\nnon-commuting Wilson lines whose presence is implied by the B-flux. In the case\nof D-branes transverse to a torus with B-flux the rank reduction is due to a\nsmaller number of D-branes required by tadpole cancellation conditions in the\npresence of B-flux as some of the orientifold planes now have the opposite\norientifold projection. We point out that T-duality in the presence of B-flux\nis more subtle than in the case with trivial B-flux, and it is precisely\nconsistent with the qualitative difference between the aforementioned two\nsetups. In the case where both types of branes are present, the states in the\nmixed (e.g., 59) open string sectors come with a non-trivial multiplicity,\nwhich we relate to a discrete gauge symmetry due to non-zero B-flux, and\nconstruct vertex operators for the the mixed sector states. Using these results\nwe revisit K3 orientifolds with B-flux (where K3 is a T^4/Z_M orbifold) and\npoint out various subtleties arising in some of these models. For instance, in\nthe Z_2 case the conformal field theory orbifold does not appear to be the\nconsistent background for the corresponding orientifolds with B-flux. This is\nrelated to the fact that non-zero B-flux requires the presence of both O5^- as\nwell as O5^+ planes at various Z_2 orbifold fixed points, which appears to be\ninconsistent with the presence of the twisted B-flux in the conformal field\ntheory orbifold. We also consider four dimensional N=2 and N=1 supersymmetric\norientifolds.

It is also\nknown that the binding energy of the nascent hot SS is likely to be radiated as\n$\\nu -\\bar\\nu$s so that an electromagnetic pair fireball (FB) may be created by\nneutrino annihilation. And already this process has been considered as a\nprobable source of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRB) by several authors, the most notable\nof which is due to Cheng & Dai (PRL, 77, 1210, 1996). They mentioned that this\nprocess may generate a FB luminosity (outside the neutrinosphere) of 10**(49)\nerg. But we point out here that a SS is a relativistic object with surface\ngravitation z=0.5. Accordingly, we present here a Relativistic Model of this\nprocess, and show that, for a massive SS with M=2 solar mass, one may explain a\nGRB energy of ~ 10**(53) erg., which is 4 orders higher than previous\nnon-relativistic estimate. Further since the baryonic mass of the thin crust of\na strange star is negligible, this FB will generate an extremely relativistic\nblast wave. Thus this process may be one of the viable routes for the genesis\nof hitherto unexplained cosmic Gamma Ray Bursts. While some of the GRBs might\nbe beamed, many of them do not show any long term spectral break in their\nafterglows and are likely to be quasi-spherical. A particular example is GRB\n971214 for which estimated GRB energy is 3. 10**(53) erg. Our model may be\nuseful for understanding the genesis of such powerful and unexplained bursts.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 00\n"}
{"prompt": "  From the AdS/CFT correspondence, we learn that the classical evolution of\nsupergravity in the bulk can be reduced to a RG-flow equation for the dual\nlow-energy, strongly coupled and large N gauge theory on the boundary. This\nresult has been used to obtain interesting relations between the various terms\nin the gravitational part of the boundary effective action, in particular the\nterm that affect the cosmological constant. It is found that once the\ncosmological constant is cancelled in the UV theory, the RG-flow symmetry of\nthe boundary effective action automatically implies the existence of zero\ncosmological constant solutions that extend all the way into the IR. Given the\nstandard (and well founded) contradiction between the RG-flow idea and the\nobservational evidence of a small cosmological constant, this is considered to\nbe an important progress, albeit incomplete, towards the final solution.\nMotivated by this success, it would be interesting to see whether this\nRG-stability extends outside the scope of strong 't Hooft coupling and large N\nregime that are implicitly assumed in the de Boer-Verlinde-Verlinde\nHamilton-Jacobi formulation of the holographic RG-flow equations of the\nboundary theory. In this paper, we address this question. Taking into account\nthe leading order corrections in the 1/N and $\\alpha'/{R^2}$ parameters, we\nderive new bulk/boundary relations, from which one can read all the local terms\nin the boundary effective action. Next, we use the resulting constraints, to\nexamine whether the RG-stability of the cosmological constant extends to the\nnew coupling regime.

Earlier, we showed that the sub-mm radiation from this source\nmay be associated with thermal synchrotron emission from an inner Keplerian\nregion within the circularization radius of the accreting plasma. In this\npaper, we extend this analysis in a very important way, by calculating the\nimplied high-energy emission of Sgr A* associated with the orbiting, hot,\nmagnetized gas. We find that for the accretion rate inferred from the fits to\nthe sub-mm data, the dominant contribution to Sgr A*'s X-ray flux is due to\nself-Comptonization of the radio photons, rather than from bremsstrahlung. The\nlatter is a two-body process, which would produce significant X-ray emission\nonly at much higher accretion rates. This picture leads to the testable\nprediction that the physical conditions within the inner $\\sim5r_S$ are\nvariable on a time scale of order a year. In particular, the accretion rate\n$\\dot M$ appears to have changed by about 15% between the sub-mm measurements\nin 1996 and 1999.

The complete set of anomalous exponents for the\npair correlation function is found non-perturbatively, in any space dimension\n$d$, using the zero-mode technique.

The energy deposited into the disk is eventually\nradiated away by the disk, which will increase the efficiency of the disk. If\nthe black hole rotates slower than the disk, energy and angular momentum are\ntransfered from the disk to the black hole, which will lower the efficiency of\nthe disk. With suitable boundary conditions, quasi-steady state solutions are\nobtained for a thin Keplerian disk magnetically coupled to a Kerr black hole.\nBy ``quasi-steady state'' we mean that any macroscopic quantity at a given\nradius in the disk slowly changes with time: the integrated change within one\nrotation period of the disk is much smaller than the quantity itself.

{"prompt": "  Recently correlation analyses between Galactic dust emission templates and a\nnumber of CMB data sets have led to differing claims on the origin of the\nGalactic contamination at low frequencies. de Oliviera-Costa {\\em et al} (1999)\nhave presented work based on Tenerife data supporting the spinning dust\nhypothesis. Since the frequency coverage of these data is ideal to discriminate\nspectrally between spinning dust and free-free emission, we used the latest\nversion of the Tenerife data, which have lower systematic uncertainty, to study\nthe correlation in more detail. We found however that the evidence in favor of\nspinning dust originates from a small region at low Galactic latitude where the\nsignificance of the correlation itself is low and is compromised by systematic\neffects in the Galactic plane signal. The rest of the region was found to be\nuncorrelated. Regions that correlate with higher significance tend to have a\nsteeper spectrum, as is expected for free-free emission. Averaging over all\ncorrelated regions yields dust-correlation coefficients of $180\\pm47$ and\n$123\\pm16$ $\\mu$K /MJy sr$^{-1}$ at 10 and 15 GHz respectively.\n  These numbers however have large systematic uncertainties that we have\nidentified and care should be taken when comparing with results from other\nexperiments. We do find evidence for synchrotron emission with spectral index\nsteepening from radio to microwave frequencies, but we cannot make conclusive\nclaims about the origin of the dust-correlated component based on the spectral\nindex estimates.

An extension of Darcy's law which explicitly\nadmits a viscous coupling between the fluids is verified, and evidence of\ncapillary effects are described. The influence of a third component, namely\nsurfactant, is studied in the same context. Invasion simulations have also been\nperformed.

At very low fluid forcing levels, this leads\nto the production of a low-resistance gel, which then slows down the progress\nof the invading fluid. At long times (beyond the water percolation threshold),\nthe concentration of remaining oil within the porous medium is lowered by the\naction of surfactant, thus enhancing oil recovery.

{"prompt": "  Reflection of X-rays from cool material around a black hole is one of the few\nobservational diagnostics of the accretion flow geometry. Models of this\nreflected spectrum generally assume that the accretion disk can be\ncharacterized by material in a single ionization state. However, several\nauthors have recently stressed the importance of the classic ionization\ninstability for X-ray irradiated gas in hydrostatic balance. This instability\nleads to a discontinuous transition in the vertical structure of the disk,\nresulting in a hot ionized skin above much cooler material. If the Compton\ntemperature of the skin is high then even iron is completely ionized, and the\nskin does not produce any spectral features. These new models, where the\nionization structure of the disk is calculated self-consistently, require an\nexcessive amount of computing power and so are difficult to use in directly\nfitting observed X-ray spectra. Instead, we invert the problem by simulating\nX-ray spectra produced by the new reflection models, and then fit these with\nthe old, single zone reflection models, to assess the extent to which the\nderived accretion geometry depends on the reflection model used. We find that\nthe single zone ionization models can severely underestimate the covering\nfraction of the ``cold'' material as seen from the X-ray source if the optical\ndepth in the ionized skin is of order unity, and that this can produce an\napparent correlation between the covering fraction and the X-ray spectral index\nsimilar in nature to that reported by Zdziarski, Lubinski and Smith (1999).\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 00\n"}

The whole GPD is\nfound to approximate the tails of the seismic moment distributions quite well\nabove moment-magnitudes larger than mW=5.3 and no statistically significant\nregional difference is found for subduction and transform seismic zones. We\nconfirm that the b-value is very different in mid-ocean ridges compared to\nother zones (b=1.50=B10.09 versus b=1.00=B10.05 corresponding to a power law\nexponent close to 1 versus 2/3) with a very high statistical confidence. We\npropose a physical mechanism for this, contrasting slow healing ruptures in\nmid-ocean ridges with fast healing ruptures in other zones. Deviations from the\nGPD at the very end of the tail are detected in the sample containing\nearthquakes from all major subduction zones (sample size of 4985 events).

Doppler shifts due to supersonic motions contain information on\nturbulent velocity field which is otherwise difficult to measure.

Using atomic hydrogen (HI) as a test case, I review techniques\napplicable to emission line studies with the emphasis on those that can provide\ninformation on the underlying power spectra of velocity and density. I show\nthat recently developed mathematical machinery is promising for the purpose.\nIts application to HI shows that in cold neutral hydrogen the velocity\nfluctuations dominate the small scale structures observed in spectral-line data\ncubes and this result is very important for the interpretation of observational\ndata, including the identification of clouds. Velocity fluctuations are shown\nto dominate the formation of small scale structures that can be erroneously\nidentified as diffuse clouds.

Previous investigations showed that\nthe perturbative contribution to the average thrust is dominated by gluons of\nsmall invariant mass, of the order of 10% of Q, where Q is the center-of-mass\nenergy. The effect of soft gluons is also important, leading to a\nnon-perturbative 1/Q correction. These conclusions are based on renormalon\nanalysis in the single dressed gluon (SDG) approximation. Here we analyze\nhigher moments of the thrust distribution using a similar technique. We find\nthat the characteristic gluon invariant mass contributing to <(1-T)^m>\nincreases with m. Yet, for m=2 this scale is quite low, around 27% of Q, and\ntherefore renormalon resummation is still very important. On the other hand,\nthe power-correction to <(1-T)^2> from a single soft gluon emission is found to\nbe highly suppressed: it scales as 1/Q^3.

We\nfind that the cumulative mass distribution of specific angular momentum, j, in\na halo of mass Mv is well fit by a universal function, M(<j) = Mv \\mu\nj/(j_0+j). This profile is defined by one shape parameter (\\mu or j_0) in\naddition to the global spin parameter \\lambda. It follows a power-law over most\nof the mass, and flattens at large j, with the flattening more pronounced for\nsmall values of \\mu. Compared to a uniform sphere in solid-body rotation, most\nhalos have a higher fraction of their mass in the low- and high-j tails of the\ndistribution. The spatial distribution of angular momentum in halos tends to be\ncylindrical and is well-aligned within each halo for ~80% of the halos. We\ninvestigate two ideas for the origin of this profile. The first is based on a\nrevised version of linear tidal-torque theory combined with extended\nPress-Schechter mass accretion, and the second focuses on j transport in minor\nmergers. Finally, we briefly explore implications of the M(<j) profile on the\nformation of galactic disks assuming that j is conserved during an adiabatic\nbaryonic infall. The implied gas density profile deviates from an exponential\ndisk, with a higher density at small radii and a tail extending to large radii.\nThe steep central density profiles may imply disk scale lengths that are\nsmaller than observed. This is reminiscent of the \"angular-momentum problem\"\nseen in hydrodynamic simulations, even though we have assumed perfect j\nconservation. A possible solution is to associate the central excesses with\nbulge components and the outer regions with extended gaseous disks.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 00\n"}

{"prompt": "  In the present paper the gauge-invariant formalism is developed for\nperturbations of the brane-world model in which our universe is realized as a\nboundary of a higher-dimensional spacetime. For the background model in which\nthe bulk spacetime is $(n+m)$-dimensional and has the spatial symmetry\ncorresponding to the isometry group of a $n$-dimensional maximally symmetric\nspace, gauge-invariant equations are derived for perturbations of the bulk\nspacetime. Further for the case corresponding to the brane-world model in which\n$m=2$ and the brane is a boundary invariant under the spatial symmetry in the\nunperturbed background, relations between the gauge-invariant variables\ndescribing the bulk perturbations and those for brane perturbations are derived\nfrom Israel's junction condition under the assumption of $\\ZR_2$ symmetry. In\nparticular, for the case in which the bulk spacetime is a constant-curvature\nspacetime, it is shown that the bulk perturbation equations reduce to a single\nhyperbolic master equation for a master variable, and that the physical\ncondition on the gauge-invariant variable describing the intrinsic stress\nperturbation of the brane yield a boundary condition for the master equation\nthrough the junction condition. On the basis of this formalism it is pointed\nout that it seems to be difficult to suppress brane perturbations corresponding\nto massive excitations for a brane motion giving a realistic expanding universe\nmodel.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 00\n"}
{"prompt": "  We investigate the evolution of the metallicity of the intergalactic medium\n(IGM) with particular emphasis on its spatial distribution. We propose that\nmetal enrichment occurs as a two step process. First, supernova (SN) explosions\neject metals into relatively small regions confined to the surroundings of\nstar-forming galaxies. From a comprehensive treatment of blowout we show that\nSNae by themselves fail by more than one order of magnitude to distribute the\nproducts of stellar nucleosynthesis over volumes large enough to pollute the\nwhole IGM to the metallicity levels observed. Thus, a additional (but as yet\nunknown) physical mechanism must be invoked to mix the metals on scales\ncomparable to the mean distance between the galaxies which are most efficient\npollutants. From this simple hypothesis we derive a number of testable\npredictions for the evolution of the IGM metallicity. Specifically, we find\nthat: (i) the fraction of metals ejected over the star formation history of the\nuniverse is about 50% at z=0; that is, approximately half of the metals today\nare found in the IGM; (ii) if the ejected metals were homogeneously mixed with\nthe baryons in the universe, the average IGM metallicity would be <Z> ~ 1/25\nZ(solar) at z=3. However, due to spatial inhomogeneities, the mean of the\ndistribution of metallicities in the diffusive zones has a wide (more than 2\norders of magnitude) spread around this value; (iii) if metals become more\nuniformly distributed at z < 1, as assumed, at z = 0 the metallicity of the IGM\nis narrowly confined within the range Z ~ 0.1 +/- 0.03 Z(solar). Finally, we\npoint out that our results can account for the observed metal content of the\nintracluster medium.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 00\n"}

In the second part, basing on simple\ngeometrical properties of Hilbert space, new, stronger Bell inequalities for M\nqubits in a maximally entangled state are derived. Application of the same\nmethod to two maximally entangled qubits yields an inequality for all possible\npositions of the local measuring apparatus. Finally, the series of the\nGreenberger-Horne- Zeilinger paradoxes for M maximally entangled quNits\nobserved via symmetric unbiased 2N ports is derived. The last part of the\nthesis is devoted to the numerical approach to the Bell theorem. The necessary\nand sufficient conditions for the violation of local realism in the case of two\nand three maximally entangled qubits, on which each observer performs up to 10\n(two qubits) and up to 5 (three qubits) local measurements, are shown. It is\nalso numerically shown that in the case of two maximally entangled quNits (3 <\nN < 9) a properly defined magnitude of violation increases with N.
