This result is robust with\nrespect to the adopted metallicity scale and the method of age determination,\nbut must bear the caveat that high quality, detailed abundance information is\nnot available for a significant fraction of the sample. When a subset of GCs\nwith similar metallicities and ages are considered, a correlation between\nd(V-I) and central luminosity density is exposed. With respect to the existence\nof GCs with anomalously red HBs at a given metallicity, we conclude that age is\nthe second parameter and central density is most likely the third. Important\nproblems related to HB morphology in GCs, notably multi-modal distributions and\nfaint blue tails, remain to be explained. (Abridged)\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 09\n"}

The desynchronization could be caused by a coupling between\nthe background gravitation and the quantum vacuum. Therefore, the standard\nargument for the incompatibility of the Pioneer acceleration and the values of\nthe planets' orbits radii cannot be applied. Second, this proposal gives\nexactly the same results for radar ranging observations as standard physics.\nHence, it cannot be in conflict with the very precise cartography of the solar\nsystem determined by NASA's Viking mission.

We apply this power\ncounting in the present study to the evaluation of the pion self-energy and the\nenergy density in nuclear and neutron matter at next-to-leading order. To\nimplement this power counting in actual calculations we develop here a\nnon-perturbative method based on Unitary Chiral Perturbation Theory for\nperforming the required resummations.

In addition, an\naccurate description of the neutron matter equation of state, as compared with\nsophisticated many-body calculations, is obtained by varying only slightly a\nsubtraction constant around its expected value. The case of symmetric nuclear\nmatter requires the introduction of an additional fine-tuned subtraction\nconstant, parameterizing the effects from higher order contributions.

{"prompt": "  It is suggested that the propagation of the action potential is accompanied\nby an axoplasmic pressure pulse propagating in the axoplasm along the axon\nlength. The pressure pulse stretch-modulates voltage-gated Na (Nav) channels\nembedded in the axon membrane, causing their accelerated activation and\ninactivation and increasing peak channel conductance. As a result, the action\npotential propagates due to mechano-electrical activation of Nav channels by\nstraggling ionic currents and the axoplasmic pressure pulse. The velocity of\nsuch propagation is higher than in the classical purely electrical Nav\nactivation mechanism, and it may be close to the velocity of propagation of\npressure pulses in the axoplasm.

We investigate\nthe evolution of this outburst with two-dimensional axisymmetric gasdynamical\ncalculations in which the cavities are inflated by relativistic cosmic rays.\nMany key observational features of the cavities and associated shocks are\nsuccessfully reproduced. The radial elongation of the cavities indicates that\ncosmic rays were injected into the cluster gas by a (jet) source moving out\nfrom the central AGN.

An analysis of gamma-ray burst data shows that the\nhypothesis of time dilation is rejected with a probability of\n4.4$\\times10^{-6}$ for redshifts out to z=6.6.

Relatively large biases are present\nfor most CMs when global energy budgets and when the atmospheric, oceanic, and\nland budgets are considered. Apparently, the biases do not result from\ntransient effects, but depend on the imperfect closure of the energy cycle in\nthe fluid components and on inconsistencies over land. Therefore, the planetary\nemission temperature is underestimated. This may explain the CMs' cold bias. In\nthe pre-industrial scenario, CMs agree on the location in the mid-latitudes of\nthe peaks of the meridional atmospheric enthalpy transport, while large\ndiscrepancies exist on the intensity. Disagreements on the location and\nintensity of the oceanic transport peaks are serious. With increased $CO_2$\nconcentration, a small poleward shift of the peak and an increase in the\nintensity of the atmospheric transport of up to 10% are detected in both\nhemispheres. Instead, most CMs feature a decrease in the oceanic transport\nintensity in the northern hemisphere and an equatorward shift of the peak in\nboth hemispheres. The Bjerkens compensation mechanism is active both on\nclimatological and interannual time scales. The peak of the total meridional\ntransport is typically around $35^\\circ$ in both hemispheres and scenarios,\nwhereas disagreements on the intensity are relevant.

For the exotic Newton-Hooke symmetry, we\nconstruct a free particle action, and realize a complete study of its classical\nand quantum properties.

We confirm that L_def correlates with BH mass MBH. Also, the fractional\nlight deficit L_def/L correlates with MBH/M, the ratio of BH mass to the galaxy\nstellar mass. All three correlations have scatter similar to or smaller than\nthe scatter in the well known correlation between MBH and sigma. The new\ncorrelations are remarkable in view of the dichotomy between ellipticals with\ncores and those with central extra light.

This supports the suggestion that\nextra light Es are made in wet mergers with starbursts whereas core Es are made\nin dry mergers.

This scaling rules out a mass conserving radial flow of n\n~ r^{-2}, or a constant density absorber, but is consistent with a\nnon-spherical MHD outflow model in which n ~ r^{-1} along any given line of\nsight. On the other hand, if ionization variations are a result of local (delta\nr) density gradients, e.g. as in the turbulent interstellar medium (ISM), the\nAMD slopes imply density scaling of n ~ delta r^{-alpha} with 0.7 < alpha <\n1.0, which is quite different from the scaling of approximately n ~ delta\nr^{0.4} found in the Milky Way ISM and typical of incompressible turbulence.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 09\n"}

Luminous blazars have also typically very hard X-ray\nspectra, and those in turn seem to challenge hadronic scenarios for the high\nenergy blazar emission. As shown in this paper, no such problems are faced by\nthe models which involve Comptonization of radiation provided by a broad\nline-region, or dusty molecular torus. The lack or weakness of bulk Compton and\nKlein-Nishina features indicated by the presently available data favors\nproduction of gamma-rays via up-scattering of infrared photons from hot dust.\nThis implies that the blazar emission zone is located at parsec-scale distances\nfrom the nucleus, and as such is possibly associated with the extended,\nquasi-stationary reconfinement shocks formed in relativistic outflows. This\nscenario predicts characteristic timescales for flux changes in luminous\nblazars to be days/weeks, consistent with the variability patterns observed in\nsuch systems at infrared, optical and gamma-ray frequencies.

GALEX and very\ndeep optical images reveal a distinct stellar ring far outside the optical body\nwith a diameter of ~30 kpc, which has undergone recent star formation at 1.8 x\n10^-4 Msun/yr/kpc^-2, consistent with other new results which detect low level\nstar formation below the traditional Kennicutt relation in the outer parts of\nspiral galaxies. The morphology of this galaxy resembles the recently\nidentified class of ultraviolet objects called extended ultraviolet disks, or\nXUV-disks. New HI observations of this galaxy taken at the ATCA and in the CnB\narray at the VLA show that the cold gas lies in an extended (diameter ~90 kpc)\nring around the central S0 galaxy. The HI data cube can be well modeled by a\nwarped ring. The faint ionized gas in the inner parts of the galaxy is\nkinematically decoupled from the stars and instead appears to exhibit\nvelocities consistent with the rotation of the HI ring at larger radius. The\npeak of the stellar ring, as seen in the optical and UV, is slightly displaced\nto the inside relative to the peak of the HI ring. We discuss the manner in\nwhich this offset could be caused by the propagation of a radial density wave\nthrough an existing stellar disk, perhaps triggered by a galaxy collision at\nthe center of the disk, or possibly due to a spiral density wave set up at\nearly times in a disk too hot to form a stellar bar. Gas accretion and\nresonance effects due to a bar which has since dissolved are also considered to\nexplain the presence of the star forming ring seen in the GALEX and deep\noptical data.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 09\n"}

The Delta Scuti stars provide more information (than\nclassical pulsators) since a number of simultaneously excited radial and\nnonradial modes can be studied. The present results indicate the presence of at\nleast two effects: beating of independent modes with close frequencies and\nstellar cycles. For period and amplitude changes with time scales less than one\nyear, we confirm the beating hypothesis in three stars. This is shown by the\ncorrectly correlated relationship between amplitude and phase changes as well\nas the repetitions of these cycles. However, the observed period variations\nwith longer time scales are not due to simple beating between two close\nfrequencies. For the star 4 CVn we can derive accurate annual frequency values\nfor at least seven radial and nonradial modes. The annual phases are in\nexcellent agreement with predictions from nearby years, thereby confirming the\nvalues and their observed long-term changes.

Based on full-potential band\nstructure calculations, we derive the relevant microscopic parameters, estimate\nindividual exchange couplings, and establish a realistic spin model of this\ncompound. The structure of CuNCN contains chains of edge-sharing CuN(4)\nsquares. As a surprise, in contrast to analogous [CuO(2)] chains in\n\"edge-sharing\" cuprates, the leading magnetic interactions J ~ 2500 K run\nperpendicular to the structural [CuN(2)] chains via bridging NCN groups. The\nresulting spin model of a uniform chain is in agreement with the experimentally\nobserved temperature-independent magnetic susceptibility below 300 K. The\nnearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor interactions along the structural\n[CuN(2)] chains are J(1) ~ -500 K and J(2) ~ 100 K, respectively. Despite the\nfrustrating nature of J(1) and J(2), we assign the anomaly at 70 K to\nlong-range magnetic ordering, which is likely collinear with antiparallel and\nparallel arrangement of spins along the 'c' and 'a' directions, respectively.\nThe pronounced one-dimensionality of the spin system should lead to a reduction\nin the ordered moment and to a suppression of the transition anomaly in the\nspecific heat, thus impeding the experimental observation of the long-range\nordering. Our results suggest CuNCN as a promising material for ballistic heat\ntransport within spin chains, while the sizable bandwidth W ~ 3 eV may lead to\na metal-insulator transition and other exotic properties under high pressure.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 09\n"}

N_H at hard energies\n(2-10 keV) seem to be much higher than what would be expected from the optical\nextinction.

The main result of this paper is that around 50% of our\nLINER sample shows signatures of Compton-thickness (CT) according to the most\ncommon tracers: the X-ray spectral index, F(2-10 keV)/F([OIII]) ratio and\nEW(FeKa). However, the EWs of CT LINERs are significantly lower than in CT Sy,\nsuggesting that the 2-10 keV emission is dominated by electron scattering of\nthe otherwise invisible AGN, or by emission from shocked gas associated to star\nformation rather than by reflection from the inner wall of the torus. However,\nno clear relation seems to exist between galaxies with optical dust lanes and\nX-ray classified CT objects. This may suggest that CT sources should be related\nto absorbing material located at the very inner regions of the AGN, maybe in\nthe putative dusty torus. Larger M_BH and lower Eddington ratios than Sy\ngalaxies have been found. This effect can be better attributed to LINER nuclei\nbeing hosted by earlier morphological types than Sy nuclei.

Combined and/or multiple application of these\nbasic operators enable a great variety of transformations of DG (and\ncorresponding RE) that can be seen as mutants of the original DG (and\ncorresponding RE). DG are popular for modeling complex systems; however they\neasily become intractable if the system under consideration is complex and/or\nlarge. In such situations, we propose to switch to corresponding RE in order to\nbenefit from their compact format for modeling and algebraic operations for\nanalysis. The results of the study are of great potential interest to mutation\ntesting.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 09\n"}
{"prompt": "  Dark energy must cluster in order to be consistent with the equivalence\nprinciple. The background evolution can be effectively modelled by either a\nscalar field or by a barotropic fluid.The fluid model can be used to emulate\nperturbations in a scalar field model of dark energy, though this model breaks\ndown at large scales. In this paper we study evolution of dark energy\nperturbations in canonical scalar field models: the classes of thawing and\nfreezing models.The dark energy equation of state evolves differently in these\nclasses.In freezing models, the equation of state deviates from that of a\ncosmological constant at early times.For thawing models, the dark energy\nequation of state remains near that of the cosmological constant at early times\nand begins to deviate from it only at late times.Since the dark energy equation\nof state evolves differently in these classes,the dark energy perturbations too\nevolve differently. In freezing models, since the equation of state deviates\nfrom that of a cosmological constant at early times, there is a significant\ndifference in evolution of matter perturbations from those in the cosmological\nconstant model.In comparison, matter perturbations in thawing models differ\nfrom the cosmological constant only at late times. This difference provides an\nadditional handle to distinguish between these classes of models and this\ndifference should manifest itself in the ISW effect.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 09\n"}
{"prompt": "  The impact of environmental variability on population size growth rate in\ndynamic models is a recurrent issue in the theoretical ecology literature. In\nthe scalar case, R. Lande pointed out that results are ambiguous depending on\nwhether the noise is added at arithmetic or logarithmic scale, while the matrix\ncase has been investigated by S. Tuljapurkar. Our contribution consists first\nin introducing another notion of variability than the widely used variance or\ncoefficient of variation, namely the so-called convex orders. Second, in\npopulation dynamics matrix models, we focus on how matrix components depend\nfunctionaly on uncertain environmental factors. In the log-convex case, we show\nthat, in a sense, environmental variability increases both mean population size\nand mean log-population size and makes them more variable. Our main result is\nthat specific analytical dependence coupled with appropriate notion of\nvariability lead to wide generic results, valid for all times and not only\nasymptotically, and requiring no assumptions of stationarity, of normality, of\nindependency, etc. Though the approach is different, our conclusions are\nconsistent with previous results in the literature.

{"prompt": "  We use an analytic model to study how inhomogeneous hydrogen reionization\naffects the temperature distribution of the intergalactic medium (IGM). During\nthis process, the residual energy of each ionizing photon is deposited in the\nIGM as heat, increasing its temperature to 20,000-30,000 K; subsequent\nexpansion of the Universe then cools the gas. Because reionization most likely\nproceeds from high to low densities, underdense voids are ionized last, have\nless time to cool, and are (on average) warmer than mean-density gas\nimmediately after reionization is complete (an \"inverted\" equation of state).\n  From this initial configuration, the low-density gas cools quickly and\neventually returns to a more normal equation of state. The rapidly evolving\ntemperature introduces systematic uncertainties in measurements of the ionizing\nbackground at z~6. For example, late reionization implies rapid cooling, so\nthat the ionizing background would have to evolve even more rapidly at z ~5-6\nthan typically claimed. This degeneracy is difficult to disentangle, because\nthe Lyman-alpha forest probes only a narrow range in densities (over which the\ngas is nearly isothermal). However, higher Lyman-series transitions probe wider\ndensity ranges, sampling different effective temperatures, and offer a new way\nto measure the IGM equation of state that should work where nearly saturated\nabsorption precludes other methods. This will help to separate evolution in\ntemperature from that in the ionizing background.

The wedge product construction can be described as an iterated\n``subdirect product'' as introduced by McMullen (1976); it is dual to the\n``wreath product'' construction of Joswig and Lutz (2005).\n  One particular instance of the wedge product construction turns out to be\nespecially interesting: The wedge products of polygons with simplices contain\ncertain combinatorially regular polyhedral surfaces as subcomplexes. These\ngeneralize known classes of surfaces ``of unusually large genus'' that first\nappeared in works by Coxeter (1937), Ringel (1956), and McMullen, Schulz, and\nWills (1983). Via ``projections of deformed wedge products'' we obtain\nrealizations of some of the surfaces in the boundary complexes of 4-polytopes,\nand thus in R^3. As additional benefits our construction also yields polyhedral\nsubdivisions for the interior and the exterior, as well as a great number of\nlocal deformations (``moduli'') for the surfaces in R^3. In order to prove that\nthere are many moduli, we introduce the concept of ``affine support sets'' in\nsimple polytopes. Finally, we explain how duality theory for 4-dimensional\npolytopes can be exploited in order to also realize combinatorially dual\nsurfaces in R^3 via dual 4-polytopes.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 09\n"}

The evolution of both heavy and light particle pairs is\nanalysed at varying the particle Stokes number and the fluid-to-particle\ndensity ratio. For heavy particles, it is found that turbulent dispersion is\nschematically governed by two temporal regimes. The first is dominated by the\npresence, at large Stokes numbers, of small-scale caustics in the particle\nvelocity statistics, and it lasts until heavy particle velocities have relaxed\ntowards the underlying flow velocities. At such large scales, a second regime\nstarts where heavy particles separate as tracers particles would do. As a\nconsequence, at increasing inertia, a larger transient stage is observed, and\nthe Richardson diffusion of simple tracers is recovered only at large times and\nlarge scales. These features also arise from a statistical closure of the\nequation of motion for heavy particle separation that is proposed, and which is\nsupported by the numerical results. In the case of light particles with high\ndensity ratios, strong small-scale clustering leads to a considerable fraction\nof pairs that do not separate at all, although the mean separation increases\nwith time. This effect strongly alters the shape of the probability density\nfunction of light particle separations.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 09\n"}

We developed a time-dependent jet model, which for\nthe first time allows one to compare the model predictions with flare data from\nSgr A*. Taking into account relevant cooling mechanisms, we calculate the\nfrequency-dependent time lags and photosphere size expected in the jet model.\nThe predicted lags and sizes are then compared with recent observations. Both\nthe observed time lags and size-frequency relationships are reproduced well by\nthe model. The combined timing and structural information strongly constrain\nthe speed of the outflow to be mildly relativistic, and the radio flares are\nlikely to be caused by a transient increase in the matter channelled into the\njets.

This approach assumes that the network is infinite and weakly\nconnected, yet furthermore approximates a dynamic cascading process as a static\npercolation event. In this paper we propose a dynamic Markov model formulation\nthat assumes a finite network with arbitrary average nodal degree. We apply it\nto the case where cascades follow a threshold rule, that is, that a node will\nchange state (\"flip\") only if a fraction, exceeding a given threshold, of its\nneighbors has changed state previously. The corresponding state transition\nmatrix, recalculated after each step, records the probability that a node of\ndegree k has i flipped neighbors after j steps in the cascade's evolution. This\ntheoretical model reproduces a number of behaviors observed in simulations but\nnot yet reported in the literature. These include the ability to predict\ncascades in a domain previously predicted to forbid cascades without assuming\nthat the network is locally tree-like, and, due to the dynamic nature of the\nmodel, a \"near death\" behavior in which cascades initially appear about to die\nbut later explode. Cascades in the \"no cascades\" region require a sufficiently\nlarge seed of initially flipped nodes whose size scales with the size of the\nnetwork or else the cascade will die out.

Here, a similar description\napplies to a rapidly rotating non-symmetric two-dimensional trap with arbitrary\nquadratic anisotropy (omega_x^2 < omega_y^2).

The\nvelocity scale of thermal broadening and the Hubble flow across the gas Jeans\nscale are of similar magnitude (Hlambda_J ~ sigma_th). To separate the effects\nof gas pressure support and thermal broadening on the Lya forest, we compare\nspectra extracted from two smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations\nevolved with different photoionization heating rates (and thus different Jeans\nscales), imposing different temperature-density relations on the evolved\nparticle distributions. The turnover scales in the flux power spectrum and flux\nautocorrelation function are determined mainly by thermal broadening rather\nthan pressure. However, the insensitivity to pressure arises partly from a\ncancellation effect with a sloped temperature-density relation (T ~ rho^{0.6}\nin our simulations): the high density peaks in the colder, lower pressure\nsimulation are less smoothed by pressure support than in the hotter simulation,\nand it is this higher density gas that experiences the strongest thermal\nbroadening. Changes in thermal broadening and pressure support have comparably\nimportant effects on the flux probability distribution (PDF), which responds\ndirectly to the gas overdensity distribution rather than the scale on which it\nis smooth. Tests on a lower resolution simulation show that our statistical\nresults are converged even at this lower resolution.

Both the\nradio and X-ray light curve show evidence for flares. The radio - X-ray\ncorrelation can be well described by a power-law with index ~0.18. This is much\nlower than the index of 0.6-0.7 found for the decay of several black hole\ntransients before. The radio spectral index measured during one of the radio\nflares while the source is in the low-hard state, is -0.5+-0.15, which\nindicates that the radio emission is optically thin.

{"prompt": "  Anisoplanatic effects can cause significant systematic photometric\nuncertainty in the analysis of dense stellar fields observed with adaptive\noptics. Program packages have been developed for a spatially variable PSF, but\nthey require that a sufficient number of bright, isolated stars in the image\nare present to adequately sample the PSF. Imaging the Galactic center is\nparticularly challenging. We present two ways of dealing with spatially\nvariable PSFs when only one or very few suitable PSF reference stars are\npresent in the field. Local PSF fitting with the StarFinder algorithm is\napplied to the data. Satisfying results can be found in two ways: (a) creating\nlocal PSFs by merging locally extracted PSF cores with the PSF wings estimated\nfrom the brightest star in the field; (b) Wiener deconvolution of the image\nwith the PSF estimated from the brightest star in the field and subsequent\nestimation of local PSFs on the deconvolved image. The methodology is tested on\nreal, and on artificial images. The method involving Wiener deconvolution of\nthe image prior to local PSF extraction and fitting gives excellent results. It\nlimits systematic effects to ~2-5% in point source photometry and ~10% in\ndiffuse emission on fields-of-view as large as 28\" x 28\" and observed through\nthe H-band filter. Particular attention is given to how deconvolution changes\nthe noise properties of the image. It is shown that mean positions and fluxes\nof the stars are conserved by the deconvolution. However, the estimated\nuncertainties of the PSF fitting algorithm are too small if the presence of\ncovariances is ignored in the PSF fitting as has been done here. An appropriate\nscaling factor can, however, be determined from simulated images or by\ncomparing measurements on independent data sets.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 09\n"}

Hence, our media-aware solution is able to provide differential\nservices for transmitting various packet classes and thereby, further improves\nthe multimedia streaming quality. We model this problem using a Finite-Horizon\nMarkov Decision Process (FHMDP) and determine the optimal congestion control\npolicy that maximizes the long-term multimedia quality, while adhering to the\nhorizon- TCP-friendliness constraint, which ensures long-term fairness with\nexisting TCP applications.

So, by using the numerical and analytical solutions of\nthe differential equation for the radiation, we construct the energy spectra\nfor different masses of the dipole-NS. These spectra show that, in relatively\nlow angular momentum l, the effect of the gravitational mass is very\nsignificant in suppressing the relativistic enhancement factor, which had been\nfound [27, 28, 32], by two to three orders of magnitude, as the mass changes\nfrom 0.5 solar mass to 3 solar masses.

An emphasis\nis on the gauge-invariance of the theory, which turns out to be essential for\nthe physical understanding of the electrodynamics of these compounds. The\ndescription of the optical response involves local (intra-bilayer and\ninter-bilayer) current densities and local conductivities. The local\nconductivities are obtained using a microscopic theory, where the\nquasiparticles of the two bands are coupled to spin fluctuations. The coupling\nleads to superconductivity and is described at the level of generalized\nEliashberg theory. Also addressed is the simpler case of quasiparticles coupled\nby a separable and nonretarded interaction. The gauge invariance of the theory\nis achieved by including a suitable class of vertex corrections. The resulting\nresponse of the model is studied in detail and an interpretation of two\nsuperconductivity-induced peaks in the experimental data of the real part of\nthe c-axis conductivity is proposed.

Simply by\nvirtue of not being flat, curved space geometries have to possess intrinsic\nlength scales, and such length scales can affect the fluid structure. For modes\nof wavelength of order or greater than such scales eikonalized geometrical\noptics cannot apply and rays are not geodesic. Covariantizing thus entails not\nonly the replacing of flat space functions by covariant ones, but also the\nintroduction of intrinsic scales that were absent in flat space. In principle\nit is thus unreliable to construct the curved space energy-momentum tensor as\nthe covariant generalization of a geodesic-based flat spacetime energy-momentum\ntensor. By constructing the partition function as an incoherent average over a\ncomplete set of modes of a scalar field propagating in a curved space\nbackground, we show that for the specific case of a static, spherically\nsymmetric geometry, the steady state energy-momentum tensor that ensues will in\ngeneral be of the form\n$T_{\\mu\\nu}=(\\rho+p)U_{\\mu}U_{\\nu}+pg_{\\mu\\nu}+\\pi_{\\mu\\nu}$ where the\nanisotropic $\\pi_{\\mu\\nu}$ is a symmetric, traceless rank two tensor which\nobeys $U^{\\mu}\\pi_{\\mu\\nu}=0$. Such a $\\pi_{\\mu\\nu}$ type term is absent for an\nincoherently averaged steady state fluid in a spacetime where there are no\nintrinsic length scales, and in principle would thus be missed in a\ncovariantizing of a flat spacetime $T_{\\mu\\nu}$. While the significance of such\n$\\pi_{\\mu\\nu}$ type terms would need to be evaluated on a case by case basis,\nthrough the use of kinetic theory we reassuringly find that the effect of such\n$\\pi_{\\mu\\nu}$ type terms is small for weak gravity stars where perfect fluid\nsources are commonly used.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 09\n"}

The majority\nof the objects in our sample are described by Spectral Energy Distributions\n(SEDs) which peak at longer wavelengths than local sources of equivalent total\ninfrared luminosity. This shift in SED peak wavelength implies a noticeable\nchange in the dust and/or star-forming properties from z~0 to the early\nUniverse, tending towards lower dust temperatures, indicative of strong\nevolution in the cold dust, `cirrus', component.

{"prompt": "  The formation and motion of lattice defects such as cracks, dislocations, or\ngrain boundaries, occurs when the lattice configuration loses stability, that\nis, when an eigenvalue of the Hessian of the lattice energy functional becomes\nnegative. When the atomistic energy is approximated by a hybrid energy that\ncouples atomistic and continuum models, the accuracy of the approximation can\nonly be guaranteed near deformations where both the atomistic energy as well as\nthe hybrid energy are stable. We propose, therefore, that it is essential for\nthe evaluation of the predictive capability of atomistic-to-continuum coupling\nmethods near instabilities that a theoretical analysis be performed, at least\nfor some representative model problems, that determines whether the hybrid\nenergies remain stable {\\em up to the onset of instability of the atomistic\nenergy}.

We present\na detailed analysis of this flare combining radio observations from 1.5 to 212\nGHz (an upper limit of the flux is also provided at 405 GHz) and X-ray.\nAlthough the observations of radio emission up to 212 GHz indicates that\nrelativistic electrons with energies of a few MeV were accelerated, no\nsignificant hard X-ray emission was detected by RHESSI above ~ 250 keV. Images\nat 12--20 and 50--100 keV reveal a very compact, but resolved, source of about\n~ 10\" x 10\". EUV TRACE images show a multi-kernel structure suggesting a\ncomplex (multipolar) magnetic topology. During the peak time the radio spectrum\nshows an extended flatness from ~ 7 to 35 GHz. Modeling the optically thin part\nof the radio spectrum as gyrosynchrotron emission we obtained the electron\nspectrum (spectral index delta, instantaneous number of emitting electrons). It\nis shown that in order to keep the expected X-ray emission from the same\nemitting electrons below the RHESSI background at 250 keV, a magnetic field\nabove 500 G is necessary. On the other hand, the electron spectrum deduced from\nradio observations >= 50 GHz is harder than that deduced from ~ 70 - 250 keV\nX-ray data, meaning that there must exist a breaking energy around a few\nhundred keV. During the decay of the impulsive phase, a hardening of the X-ray\nspectrum is observed which is interpreted as a hardening of the electron\ndistribution spectrum produced by the diffusion due to Coulomb collisions of\nthe trapped electrons in a medium with an electron density of n_e ~ 3E10 - 5E10\ncm-3.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 09\n"}

Our primary\nresource is the Hamburg/ESO Survey (HES), which provides a well-defined sample\nof more than 300 optically bright AGN with redshifts z<0.3 and blue magnitudes\nB<17.5. AGN luminosities were estimated in two ways, always taking care to\nminimise photometric biases due to host galaxy light contamination. Firstly, we\nmeasured broad-band B_J (blue) magnitudes of the objects over small apertures\nof the size of the seeing disk. Secondly, we extracted H alpha and H beta broad\nemission line luminosities from the spectra which should be entirely free of\nany starlight contribution. The resulting AGN luminosity function (AGNLF) is\nconsistent with a single power law, also when considering the effects of number\ndensity evolution within the narrow redshift range. We compared our AGNLF with\nthe H alpha luminosity function of lower luminosity Seyfert 1 galaxies by Hao\net al.

From the combination of HES and SDSS\nsamples we constructed a single local AGNLF spanning more than 4 orders of\nmagnitude in luminosity.

At small sub-granulation scales, the kinetic energy spectral density\nassociated with vertical motions exhibits a k^{-10/3}-like spectrum, while the\nintensity fluctuation spectrum follows a k^{-3} or k^{-17/3}-like spectrum at\nthe two continuum levels investigated (525 and 450 nm respectively). We discuss\nthe physical origin of these scalings and argue that they provide a direct\nobservational signature of buoyancy-driven turbulent dynamics in a strongly\nthermally diffusive regime. In the mesogranulation range and up to a scale of\n25Mm, we find that the vertical velocity field amplitude decreases like\nL^{-3/2} with the horizontal scale L. This behaviour corresponds to a k^2\nspectral power law. Still in the mesoscale range, [2.5, 10]Mm, we find that\nintensity fluctuations in the blue continuum follow a power law in k^2. We show\nthat granule tracking cannot sample scales below 2.5Mm. We locate the\nsupergranulation energy peak around 30Mm and show that the emergence of a pore\nerases this spectral peak. Thanks to a scale height estimate, we find that\nsupergranular flows are shallow. (abridged abstract).\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 09\n"}

{"prompt": "  Wiener and Granger have introduced an intuitive concept of causality between\ntwo variables which is based on the idea that an effect never occurs before its\ncause. Later, Geweke has generalized this concept to a multivariate Granger\ncausality, i.e., n variables Granger-cause another variable. Although Granger\ncausality is not \"effective causality\", this concept is useful to infer\ndirectionality and information flow in observational data. Granger causality is\nusually identified by using VAR models due to their simplicity. In the last few\nyears, several VAR-based models were presented in order to model gene\nregulatory networks. Here, we generalize the multivariate Granger causality\nconcept in order to identify Granger causalities between sets of gene\nexpressions, i.e., whether a set of n genes Granger-causes another set of m\ngenes, aiming at identifying and quantifying the flow of information between\ngene networks (or pathways). The concept of Granger causality for sets of\nvariables is presented. Moreover, a method for its identification with a\nbootstrap test is proposed. This method is applied in simulated and also in\nactual biological gene expression data in order to model regulatory networks.\nThis concept may be useful to understand the complete information flow from one\nnetwork or pathway to the other, mainly in regulatory networks. Linking this\nconcept to graph theory, sink and source can be generalized to node sets.\nMoreover, hub and centrality for sets of genes can be defined based on total\ninformation flow. Another application is in annotation, when the functionality\nof a set of genes is unknown, but this set is Granger caused by another set of\ngenes which is well studied. Therefore, this information may be useful to infer\nor construct some hypothesis about the unknown set of genes.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 09\n"}

While we find far fewer candidates for major mergers than the SINS\nsample at z~2, our data are sensitive enough to trace less violent processes.\nMost irregular signatures are related to star formation events and less massive\ndisks are affected more than Milky-Way type objects. We detect similarly high\nfractions of irregular objects both for the distant field and cluster galaxies\nwith similar distributions. We conclude that we may witness the building-up of\ndisk galaxies still at redshifts z~0.5 via minor mergers and gas accretion,\nwhile some cluster members may additionally experience stripping, evaporation\nor harassment interactions.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 09\n"}

We show that it is not possible to generate an asymmetry\nwith this scale dependence by changing the relative contributions of the\ninflaton and curvaton to the adiabatic power spectrum. Instead, we consider\ncurvaton scenarios in which the curvaton decays after dark matter freezes out,\nthus generating isocurvature perturbations. If there is a superhorizon\nfluctuation in the curvaton field, then the rms amplitude of these\nperturbations will be asymmetric, and the asymmetry will be most apparent on\nlarge angular scales in the CMB. We find that it is only possible to generate\nthe observed asymmetry in the CMB while satisfying the quasar constraint if the\ncurvaton's contribution to the total dark matter density is small, but nonzero.\nThe model also requires that the majority of the primordial power comes from\nfluctuations in the inflaton field.

For example, it has been\nindicated that the dynamical friction doesn't work in cored density profiles\n(constant density in the central region) despite that the Chandrasekhar formula\npredicts drag force even in the constant densities. In the former half of this\npaper, I discuss by N-body simulations that many-body interactions are also\nimportant in actual dynamical friction though derivation of the Chandrasekhar\nformula is based on the assumption of two-body interaction.

In this paper, we show that\nrandom domino tilings of the Aztec diamond are asymptotically related to random\nsquare Young tableaux in a more refined sense that looks also at the behavior\ninside the arctic circle. This is done by giving a new derivation of the\nlimiting shape of the height function of a random domino tiling of the Aztec\ndiamond that uses the large-deviation techniques developed for the square Young\ntableaux problem in a previous paper by Pittel and the author. The solution of\nthe variational problem that arises for domino tilings is almost identical to\nthe solution for the case of square Young tableaux by Pittel and the author.\nThe analytic techniques used to solve the variational problem provide a\nsystematic, guess-free approach for solving problems of this type which have\nappeared in a number of related combinatorial probability models.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 09\n"}

{"prompt": "  In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework to construct matching\nalgorithms for any biometric authentication systems. Conventional matching\nalgorithms are not necessarily secure against strong intentional impersonation\nattacks such as wolf attacks. The wolf attack is an attempt to impersonate a\ngenuine user by presenting a \"wolf\" to a biometric authentication system\nwithout the knowledge of a genuine user's biometric sample. A wolf is a sample\nwhich can be accepted as a match with multiple templates. The wolf attack\nprobability (WAP) is the maximum success probability of the wolf attack, which\nwas proposed by Une, Otsuka, Imai as a measure for evaluating security of\nbiometric authentication systems. We present a principle for construction of\nsecure matching algorithms against the wolf attack for any biometric\nauthentication systems. The ideal matching algorithm determines a threshold for\neach input value depending on the entropy of the probability distribution of\nthe (Hamming) distances. Then we show that if the information about the\nprobability distribution for each input value is perfectly given, then our\nmatching algorithm is secure against the wolf attack. Our generalized matching\nalgorithm gives a theoretical framework to construct secure matching\nalgorithms. How lower WAP is achievable depends on how accurately the entropy\nis estimated. Then there is a trade-off between the efficiency and the\nachievable WAP. Almost every conventional matching algorithm employs a fixed\nthreshold and hence it can be regarded as an efficient but insecure instance of\nour theoretical framework. Daugman's IrisCode recognition algorithm proposed\ncan also be regarded as a non-optimal instance of our framework.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 09\n"}
