{"prompt": "  A systematic study of optical and transport properties of the Hubbard model,\nbased on Metzner and Vollhardt's dynamical mean-field approximation, is\nreviewed. This model shows interesting anomalous properties that are, in our\nopinion, ubiquitous to single-band strongly correlated systems (for all spatial\ndimensions greater than one), and also compare qualitatively with many\nanomalous transport features of the high-T$_c$ cuprates. This anomalous\nbehavior of the normal-state properties is traced to a ``collective single-band\nKondo effect,'' in which a quasiparticle resonance forms at the Fermi level as\nthe temperature is lowered, ultimately yielding a strongly renormalized Fermi\nliquid at zero temperature.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20su"}
{"prompt": "  Magnetic flux can penetrate a type-II superconductor in form of Abrikosov\nvortices. These tend to arrange in a triangular flux-line lattice (FLL) which\nis more or less perturbed by material inhomogeneities that pin the flux lines,\nand in high-$T_c$ supercon- ductors (HTSC's) also by thermal fluctuations. Many\nproperties of the FLL are well described by the phenomenological\nGinzburg-Landau theory or by the electromagnetic London theory, which treats\nthe vortex core as a singularity. In Nb alloys and HTSC's the FLL is very soft\nmainly because of the large magnetic penetration depth: The shear modulus of\nthe FLL is thus small and the tilt modulus is dispersive and becomes very small\nfor short distortion wavelength. This softness of the FLL is enhanced further\nby the pronounced anisotropy and layered structure of HTSC's, which strongly\nincreases the penetration depth for currents along the c-axis of these uniaxial\ncrystals and may even cause a decoupling of two-dimensional vortex lattices in\nthe Cu-O layers. Thermal fluctuations and softening may melt the FLL and cause\nthermally activated depinning of the flux lines or of the 2D pancake vortices\nin the layers. Various phase transitions are predicted for the FLL in layered\nHTSC's. The linear and nonlinear magnetic response of HTSC's gives rise to\ninteresting effects which strongly depend on the geometry of the experiment.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20su"}
{"prompt": "  Vortex structure of $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductors is microscopically\nanalyzed in the framework of the quasi-classical Eilenberger equations. If the\npairing interaction contains an $s$-wave ($d_{xy}$-wave) component in addition\nto a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave component, the $s$-wave ($d_{xy}$-wave) component of\nthe order parameter is necessarily induced around a vortex in\n$d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductors. The spatial distribution of the induced\n$s$-wave and $d_{xy}$-wave components is calculated. The $s$-wave component has\nopposite winding number around vortex near the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-vortex core and\nits amplitude has the shape of a four-lobe clover. The amplitude of\n$d_{xy}$-component has the shape of an octofoil. These are consistent with\nresults based on the GL theory.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20su"}
{"prompt": "  Vortex structure of pure $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductors is\nmicroscopically analyzed in the framework of the quasi-classical Eilenberger\nequations. Selfconsistent solution for the $d$-wave pair potential is obtained\nfor the first time in the case of an isolated vortex. The vortex core\nstructure, i.e., the pair potential, the supercurrent and the magnetic field,\nis found to be fourfold symmetric even in the case that the mixing of $s$-wave\ncomponent is absent. The detailed temperature dependences of these quantities\nare calculated. The fourfold symmetry becomes clear when temperature is\ndecreased. The local density of states is calculated for the selfconsistently\nobtained pair potential. From the results, we discuss the flow trajectory of\nthe quasiparticles around a vortex, which is characteristic in the\n$d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductors. The experimental relevance of our results\nto high temperature superconductors is also given.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20su"}

{"prompt": "  The vortex contribution to the dc field (H) dependent microwave surface\nimpedance Z_s = R_s+iX_s of YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-x} thin films was measured using\nsuspended patterned resonators. Z_s(H) is shown to be a direct measure of the\nflux density B(H) enabling a very precise test of models of flux penetration.\nThree regimes of field-dependent behavior were observed: (1) Initial flux\npenetration occurs on very low field scales H_i(4.2K) 100Oe, (2) At moderate\nfields the flux penetration into the virgin state is in excellent agreement\nwith calculations based upon the field-induced Bean critical state for thin\nfilm geometry, parametrized by a field scale H_s(4.2K) J_c*d 0.5T, (3) for very\nhigh fields H >>H_s, the flux density is uniform and the measurements enable\ndirect determination of vortex parameters such as pinning force constants\n\\alpha_p and vortex viscosity \\eta. However hysteresis loops are in\ndisagreement with the thin film Bean model, and instead are governed by the low\nfield scale H_i, rather than by H_s.
