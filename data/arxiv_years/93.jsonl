We describe a series of\nprojects based upon perturbative expansions to follow the gravitational\nevolution of the one point probability distribution functions (PDFs) for the\ndensity contrast field and for the divergence of the corresponding velocity\nfield. The Edgeworth expansion greatly simplifies the problem. Indeed, the PDF\ncan be described through several low order moments, with the first non-trivial\ncontribution coming from the skewness, or third moment. Gaussian initial\nconditions imply that the skewness of the smoothed density field is\nproportional to the square of the variance. The constant of proportionality is\nthen a function of the logarithmic slope of the variance versus scale, and is\notherwise independent of scale. This constant is also practically independent\nof the density parameter $\\Omega$, and has very nearly the same value when\ndistances are estimated by redshifts. To show the latter property, we also\nbriefly discuss our Lagrangian approach to perturbation theory. Finally, the\nobserved skewness does depend, of course, on the relation between the\ndistribution of light and mass; we describe the case of local biasing. For the\ndivergence of the velocity field, the skewness of its PDF is also proportional\nto the square of its variance, but the ratio now strongly depends on the value\nof $\\Omega$.

Interestingly enough, for all three ansatzes, anisotropies on\nangular scales larger than the curvature scale are suppressed relative to the\nanisotropies on scales smaller than the curvature scale. Models with\n$0.2<\\Omega h<0.3$ appear compatible with CMB fluctuations detected by COBE and\nTenerife and with the amplitude and spectrum of fluctuations of galaxy counts\nin galaxy surveys.

{"prompt": "  Structures such as waves, jets, and vortices have a dramatic impact on the\ntransport properties of a flow. Passive tracer transport in incompressible\ntwo-dimensional flows is described by Hamiltonian dynamics, and, for idealized\nstructures, the system is typically integrable. When such structures are\nperturbed, chaotic trajectories can result which can significantly change the\ntransport properties. It is proposed that the transport due to the chaotic\nregions can be efficiently calculated using Hamiltonian mappings designed\nspecifically for the structure of interest. As an example a new map is\nconstructed, appropriate for studying transport by propagating isolated\nvortices. It is found that a perturbed vortex will trap fluid parcels for\nvarying lengths of time, and that the distribution of such trapping times has\nslopes which are independent of the amplitudes of both the vortex and the\nperturbation.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 93"}

It is shown that for the case of a localized hole, a strong\ninteraction of the hole with the electron lattice tends to wipe out this\nstructure.

We then show that, for\nnull-flat spaces, the critical dimension, for which the CKE has infinitely many\nsolutions, is equal to the rank of the metric. Therefore, in order to construct\nan integrable conformal field theory in 4 dimensions we need to rely on\nfourth-rank geometry.

{"prompt": "  Considerable interest has recently been expressed in the entropy versus area\nrelationship for ``dirty'' black holes --- black holes in interaction with\nvarious classical matter fields, distorted by higher derivative gravity, or\ninfested with various forms of quantum hair. In many cases it is found that the\nentropy is simply related to the area of the event horizon: S = k\nA_H/(4\\ell_P^2). For example, the ``entropy = (1/4) area'' law *holds* for:\nSchwarzschild, Reissner--Nordstrom, Kerr--Newman, and dilatonic black holes. On\nthe other hand, the ``entropy = (1/4) area'' law *fails* for: various types of\n(Riemann)^n gravity, Lovelock gravity, and various versions of quantum hair.\nThe pattern underlying these results is less than clear. This paper\nsystematizes these results by deriving a general formula for the entropy: S =\n{k A_H/(4\\ell_P^2)}\n  + {1/T_H} \\int_\\Sigma [rho - {L}_E ] K^\\mu d\\Sigma_\\mu\n  + \\int_\\Sigma s V^\\mu d\\Sigma_\\mu.

{"prompt": "  The solution $u(t,x,y)$ of the Kadomtsev--Petviashvili I (KPI) equation with\ngiven initial data $u(0,x,y)$ belonging to the Schwartz space is considered. No\nadditional special constraints, usually considered in literature, as\n$\\int\\!dx\\,u(0,x,y)=0$ are required to be satisfied by the initial data. The\nproblem is completely solved in the framework of the spectral transform theory\nand it is shown that $u(t,x,y)$ satisfies a special evolution version of the\nKPI equation and that, in general, $\\partial_t u(t,x,y)$ has different left and\nright limits at the initial time $t=0$. The conditions of the type\n$\\int\\!dx\\,u(t,x,y)=0$, $\\int\\!dx\\,xu_y(t,x,y)=0$ and so on (first, second,\netc. `constraints') are dynamically generated by the evolution equation for\n$t\\not=0$. On the other side $\\int\\!dx\\!\\!\\int\\!dy\\,u(t,x,y)$ with prescribed\norder of integrations is not necessarily equal to zero and gives a nontrivial\nintegral of motion.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 93"}
