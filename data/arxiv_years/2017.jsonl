Actually, this is shown to be an instance of a general result, which\nholds for flow both in flat (Euclidean) space and in a curved Riemannian space:\nany Lie-advection invariant p-form which is exact (i.e. is a differential of a\n(p-1)-form) has an associated Cauchy invariants equation and a Cauchy formula.\nThis constitutes a new fundamental result in linear transport theory, providing\na Lagrangian formulation of Lie advection for some classes of differential\nforms.

In contrast, a statistically optimal analysis that employs\npartitioning measurements, incorporating all partitioned results and their\nknown correlations, is found to yield an improvement -- typically slight --\nover the noise reduction achieved by WVA.

A remaining drawback of\ndeep learning approaches is their requirement for an expensive retraining\nwhenever the specific problem, the noise level, noise type, or desired measure\nof fidelity changes. On the contrary, variational methods have a plug-and-play\nnature as they usually consist of separate data fidelity and regularization\nterms.\n  In this paper we study the possibility of replacing the proximal operator of\nthe regularization used in many convex energy minimization algorithms by a\ndenoising neural network.

{"prompt": "  In recent years, two-player zero-sum games with multiple objectives have\nreceived a lot of interest as a model for the synthesis of complex reactive\nsystems. In this framework, Player 1 wins if he can ensure that all objectives\nare satisfied against any behavior of Player 2. When this is not possible to\nsatisfy all the objectives at once, an alternative is to use some preorder on\nthe objectives according to which subset of objectives Player 1 wants to\nsatisfy. For example, it is often natural to provide more significance to one\nobjective over another, a situation that can be modelled with lexicographically\nordered objectives for instance. Inspired by recent work on concurrent games\nwith multiple {\\omega}-regular objectives by Bouyer et al., we investigate in\ndetail turned-based games with monotonically ordered and {\\omega}-regular\nobjectives. We study the threshold problem which asks whether player 1 can\nensure a payoff greater than or equal to a given threshold w.r.t. a given\nmonotonic preorder. As the number of objectives is usually much smaller than\nthe size of the game graph, we provide a parametric complexity analysis and we\nshow that our threshold problem is in FPT for all monotonic preorders and all\nclassical types of {\\omega}-regular objectives.

However, the\nlevitatable objects in the previous studies were limited to particles smaller\nthan the wavelength, or flat parts placed near a rigid wall. Here, we achieve a\nstable levitation of a macroscopic rigid body by a holographic design of\nacoustic field without any dynamic control. The levitator models the acoustic\nradiation force and torque applied to a rigid body by discretising the body's\nsurface, as well as the acoustic wave sources, and optimizes the acoustic field\non the body surface to achieve the Lyapunov stability so that the field can\nproperly respond to the fluctuation of the body position and rotation.

Water worlds are efficiently formed in the HZ in\ndifferent dynamical scenarios. In systems with a giant planet analog to Jupiter\nor Saturn around the snow line, super-Earths tend to migrate into the HZ from\noutside the snow line as a result of interactions with other embryos and\naccrete water only during the gaseous phase.

{"prompt": "  We present results of elaborate four-dimensional simulations of the\npropagation of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR), which are based on a\nrealistic astrophysical scenario. The distribution of the arrival directions of\nthe UHECR is found to have a pronounced dipolar anisotropy and rather weak\nhigher-order contributions to the angular power spectrum. This finding agrees\nwell with the recent observation of a dipolar anisotropy for UHECR with arrival\nenergies above 8 EeV by the Pierre Auger Observatory and constitutes an\nimportant prediction for other energy ranges and higher-order angular\ncontributions for which sufficient experimental data are not yet available.\nSince our astrophysical scenario enables simulations that are completely\nconsistent with the available data, this scenario will be a very useful basis\nfor related future studies.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2017"}

This paper outlines the Robust Reading\nCompetition Annotation and Evaluation Platform, the backbone of the\ncompetitions. The RRC Annotation and Evaluation Platform is a modular\nframework, fully accessible through on-line interfaces. It comprises a\ncollection of tools and services for managing all processes involved with\ndefining and evaluating a research task, from dataset definition to annotation\nmanagement, evaluation specification and results analysis. Although the\nframework has been designed with robust reading research in mind, many of the\nprovided tools are generic by design.

{"prompt": "  Consider a channel allocation problem over a frequency-selective\nchannel.There are K channels (frequency bands) and N users such that K=bN for\nsome positive integer b. We want to allocate b channels (or resource blocks) to\neach user. Due to the nature of the frequency-selective channel, each user\nconsiders some channels to be better than others. The optimal solution to this\nresource allocation problem can be computed using the Hungarian algorithm.\nHowever, this requires knowledge of the numerical value of all the channel\ngains, which makes this approach impractical for large networks. We suggest a\nsuboptimal approach, that only requires knowing what the M-best channels of\neach user are. We find the minimal value of M such that there exists an\nallocation where all the b channels each user gets are among his M-best. This\nleads to feedback of significantly less than one bit per user per channel. For\na large class of fading distributions, including Rayleigh, Rician, m-Nakagami\nand others, this suboptimal approach leads to both an asymptotically (in K)\noptimal sum-rate and an asymptotically optimal minimal rate. Our\nnon-opportunistic approach achieves (asymptotically) full multiuser diversity\nas well as optimal fairness, by contrast to all other limited feedback\nalgorithms.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2017"}

{"prompt": "  Recent numerical simulations of hard helical particle systems unveiled the\nexistence of a novel chiral nematic phase, termed screw-like, characterised by\nthe helical organization of the particle C$_2$ symmetry axes round the nematic\ndirector with periodicity equal to the particle pitch. This phase forms at high\ndensity and can follow a less dense uniform nematic phase, with relative\noccurrence of the two phases depending on the helix morphology. Since these\nnumerical simulations were conducted under three-dimensional periodic boundary\nconditions, two questions could remain open. Firstly, the real nature of the\nlower density nematic phase, expected to be cholesteric. Secondly, the\ninfluence that the latter, once allowed to form, may have on the existence and\nstability of the screw-like nematic phase. To address these questions, we have\nperformed Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics numerical simulations of helical\nparticle systems confined between two parallel repulsive walls. We have found\nthat removal of the periodicity constraint along one direction allows a\nrelatively-long-pitch cholesteric phase to form, in lieu of the uniform nematic\nphase, with helical axis perpendicular to the walls while the existence and\nstability of the screw-like nematic phase are not appreciably affected by this\nchange of boundary conditions.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2017"}
