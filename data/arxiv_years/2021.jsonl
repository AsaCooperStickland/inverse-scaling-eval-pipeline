However, it remains unclear whether and how this code could be\nimplemented in neural circuits.

Here, we present a new framework to\nstudy recursive processing in RNNs, using subject-verb agreement as a probe\ninto the representations of the neural network. We trained six distinct types\nof RNNs on a simplified probabilistic context-free grammar designed to\nindependently manipulate the length of a sentence and the depth of its\nsyntactic tree. All RNNs generalized to subject-verb dependencies longer than\nthose seen during training. However, none systematically generalized to deeper\ntree structures, even those with a structural bias towards learning nested tree\n(i.e., stack-RNNs). In addition, our analyses revealed primacy and recency\neffects in the generalization patterns of LSTM-based models, showing that these\nmodels tend to perform well on the outer- and innermost parts of a\ncenter-embedded tree structure, but poorly on its middle levels. Finally,\nprobing the internal states of the model during the processing of sentences\nwith nested tree structures, we found a complex encoding of grammatical\nagreement information (e.g. grammatical number), in which all the information\nfor multiple words nouns was carried by a single unit. Taken together, these\nresults indicate how neural networks may extract bounded nested tree\nstructures, without learning a systematic recursive rule.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2021"}

{"prompt": "  This letter revisits the energy quadratization (EQ) method by introducing a\nnovel and essential relaxation technique to improve its accuracy and stability.\nThe EQ method has witnessed significant popularity in the past few years.\nThough acknowledging its effectiveness in designing energy-stable schemes for\nthermodynamically consistent models, the primary known drawback is apparent,\ni.e., its preserves a \"modified\" energy law represented by auxiliary variables\ninstead of the original variables. Truncation errors are introduced during\nnumerical calculations so that the numerical solutions of the auxiliary\nvariables are no longer equivalent to their original continuous definitions.\nEven though the \"modified\" energy dissipation law is preserved, the original\nenergy dissipation law is not guaranteed. In this paper, we overcome this issue\nby introducing a relaxation technique. The computational cost of this extra\ntechnique is negligible compared with the baseline EQ method. Meanwhile, the\nrelaxed-EQ method holds all the baseline EQ method's good properties, such as\nlinearity and unconditionally energy stability.

Both plasmons and single-particle excitations (SPEs) are\neigenstates of bulk metallic systems and they are orthogonal to each other.\nHowever, in non-translationally symmetric systems such as nanostructures,\nplasmons and SPEs coherently interact. It has been well discussed that the\nplasmons and SPEs, respectively, can couple with transverse (T) electric field\nin such systems, and also that they are coupled with each other via\nlongitudinal (L) field. However, there has been a missing link in the previous\nstudies: the coherent coupling between the plasmons and SPEs mediated by the T\nfield. Herein, we develop a theoretical framework to describe the\nself-consistent relationship between plasmons and SPEs through both the L and T\nfields.

The core intuition behind our method is that better\ndrivability and generalization can be achieved by disentangling the driving\nsignals and remaining generative factors, which are not available during\nanimation. To this end, we explicitly account for information deficiency in the\ndriving signal by introducing a latent space that exclusively captures the\nremaining information, thus enabling the imputation of the missing factors\nrequired during full-body animation, while remaining faithful to the driving\nsignal.

Moreover, to eventually achieve the desired noise\nlevel, the phase fluctuations of the onboard ultra-stable oscillator must also\nbe suppressed. This can be fulfilled by introducing sideband signals which, in\nturn, give rise to an improved cancellation scheme accounting for the\nclock-jitter noise.

Although it is well-known\nthat the two-stage approach outperforms the one-stage approach in general\nobject detection, they have performed similarly in parking slot detection so\nfar. We consider this is because the two-stage approach has not yet been\nadequately specialized for parking slot detection. Thus, this paper proposes a\nhighly specialized two-stage parking slot detector that uses region-specific\nmulti-scale feature extraction. In the first stage, the proposed method finds\nthe entrance of the parking slot as a region proposal by estimating its center,\nlength, and orientation. The second stage of this method designates specific\nregions that most contain the desired information and extracts features from\nthem.

In addition, multi-resolution feature maps are\nutilized to increase both positioning and classification accuracies.

This framework takes advantage of digital image processing\nalgorithms to identify the salient material features of OPVs undergoing the\ncharge transport phenomenon. These material states are then used to obtain a\nlow-dimensional representation of OPV microstructures via 2-point spatial\ncorrelations and principal component analysis.

A simple\ndescription of this phenomenon is obtained by a quantum master equation\ndescribing a quantum walk over the molecular network in the presence of\ninter-site decoherence. We consider the problem of simulating the dynamics\nunderlying ENAQT in a digital quantum computer. Two different quantum\nalgorithms are introduced, the first one based on stochastic Hamiltonians and\nthe second one based on a collision scheme. We test both algorithms by\nsimulating ENAQT in a small molecular network on a quantum computer emulator\nand provide a comparative analysis of the two approaches. Both algorithms can\nbe implemented in a memory efficient encoding with the number of required\nqubits scaling logarithmically with the size of the simulated system while the\nnumber of gates increases quadratically. We discuss the algorithmic quantum\ntrajectories generated by the two simulation strategies showing that they\nrealize distinct unravellings of the site-dephasing master equation.

We also consider\nperiodic homogenization for operators with degeneration.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2021"}
{"prompt": "  In a moving acoustic medium, sound waves travel differently with and against\nthe fluid flow. This well-established acoustic effect is backed by the\nintuition that the fluid velocity bias imparts momentum on the propagating\nacoustic waves, thus violating reciprocity. Based on this conception, fluid\nflow that is transverse to the wave direction of propagation will not break\nreciprocity. In this letter we contrast this common wisdom and theoretically\nshow that the interplay between transverse mean flow and transverse structural\ngliding-asymmetry can yield strong nonreciprocity and even, surprisingly,\none-way waveguiding which is rare in acoustics.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2021"}
