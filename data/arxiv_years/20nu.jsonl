{"prompt": "  The elliptic flow of Lambda hyperons has been measured by the NA49\ncollaboration at the CERN-SPS in semi-central Pb+Pb collisions at 158A GeV. The\nstandard method of correlating particles with the event plane was used.\nMeasurements of v2 near mid-rapidity are reported as a function of rapidity,\ncentrality and transverse momentum. Elliptic flow of Lambda particles increases\nboth with the impact parameter and with the transverse momentum. It is compared\nwith v2 for pions and protons as well as with model calculations. The\nobservation of significant elliptic flow and its mass dependence suggest strong\ncollective behaviour of the matter produced in collisions of heavy nuclei\nalready at the SPS. Scaling properties of elliptic flow of different particle\nspecies have been tested at 158A GeV. The limited pT range of the data does not\nallow for a decisive test of the coalescence model.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20nu"}

{"prompt": "  Low energy nucleon dynamics in the effective field theory (EFT) of nuclear\nforces is investigated by using the formalism of the generalized quantum\ndynamics (GQD). This formalism is based on a generalized dynamical equation\nderived as the most general equation of motion consistent with the current\nconcepts of quantum theory and allows one to extend quantum dynamics to the\ncase where the fundamental interaction in a quantum system is nonlocal in time.\nThe Schr{\\\"o}dinger equation follows from this equation in the case where the\ninteraction in a system is instantaneous. We show that the effective theory of\nnuclear forces gives rise to low energy nucleon dynamics which is governed by\nthe generalized dynamical equation with a nonlocal-in-time interaction\noperator. This operator is shown to provide a natural parametrization of the\ninteraction of nucleons and can be derived order by order by using methods of\nsubtractive EFT's. We show that the use of the GQD for describing nucleon\ndynamics allows one to formulate the EFT of nuclear forces as a completely\nconsistent theory with a well-defined equation of motion which does not require\nrenormalization.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20nu"}

{"prompt": "  Given presently known empirical information about the exotic Theta+ baryon,\nwe analyze possible properties of its SU(3)F partners, paying special attention\nto the nonstrange member of the antidecuplet N*. The modified PWA analysis\npresents two candidate masses, 1680 MeV and 1730 MeV. In both cases the N*\nshould be highly inelastic. The theoretical analysis, based on the soliton\npicture and assumption of Gamma(Theta+) < 5 MeV, shows that most probably\nGamma(N*) < 30 MeV. Similar analysis for Xi3/2 predicts its width to be not\nmore than about 10 MeV. Our results suggest several directions for experimental\nstudies that may clarify properties of the antidecuplet baryons, and structure\nof their mixing with other baryons.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20nu"}
{"prompt": "  Combining the hydrodynamic equations for the QGP evolution and the transport\nequation for the primordially produced $J/\\psi$ in the QGP, we investigate the\n$J/\\psi$ transverse momentum distribution as well as its suppression in the\n$\\sqrt{s}$=17.3A GeV Pb-Pb collisions at SPS and $\\sqrt{s}$=200A GeV Au-Au\ncollisions at RHIC. The two sets of equations are connected by the $J/\\psi$\nanomalous suppression induced by its inelastic scattering with gluons in the\nQGP. The calculated centrality dependence of $J/\\psi$ suppression and average\ntransverse momentum square agree well with the SPS data. From the comparison\nwith the coalescence model where charm quark is fully thermalized, our\ncalculated elliptical flow of the primordially produced $J/\\psi$ is much\nsmaller. This may be helpful to differentiate the $J/\\psi$ production\nmechanisms in relativistic heavy ion collisions.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20nu"}
{"prompt": "  A search for the self-consistent solutions for the chiral rotational bands in\nthe N=75 isotones, 130Cs, 132La, 134Pr and 136Pm is performed within the\nSkyrme-Hartree-Fock cranking approach using SKM* and SLy4 parametrizations. The\ndependence of the solutions on the time-odd contributions in the energy\nfunctional is studied. From among the considered four isotones, self-consistent\nchiral solutions are obtained only in 132La. The microscopic calculations are\ncompared with the 132La experimental data and with results of a classical model\nthat contains all the mechanisms underlying the chirality of the collective\nrotational motion. Strong similarities between the HF and classical model\nresults are found. The suggestion formulated earlier by the authors that the\nchiral rotation cannot exist below a certain critical frequency is further\nillustrated and discussed, together with the microscopic origin of a transition\nfrom the planar to chiral rotation in nuclei. We also formulate the\nseparability rule by which the Tilted-Axis-Cranking solutions can be inferred\nfrom three independent Principal-Axis-Cranking solutions corresponding to three\ndifferent axes of rotation.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20nu"}

{"prompt": "  We introduce a new approach to highly correlated systems which generalizes\nthe Fermi Hypernetted Chain and Correlated Basis Function techniques. While the\nlatter approaches can only be applied to systems for which a nonrelativistic\nwave function can be defined, the new approach is based on the variation of a\ntrial hamiltonian within a path integral framework and thus can also be applied\nto relativistic and field theoretical problems. We derive a diagrammatic scheme\nfor the new approach and show how a particular choice of the trial hamiltonian\ncorresponds exactly to the use of a Jastrow correlated ansatz for the wave\nfunction in the Fermi Hypernetted Chain approach. We show how our new approach\ncan be used to find upper bounds to ground state energies in systems which the\nFHNC cannot handle, including those described by an energy-dependent effective\nhamiltonian. We demonstrate our approach by applying it to a quantum field\ntheoretical system of interacting pions and nucleons.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20nu"}
{"prompt": "  Conventional theories of nuclear interactions predict a net increase in the\ndistribution of virtual pions in nuclei relative to free nucleons. Analysis of\ndata from several nuclear experiments has led to claims of evidence against\nsuch a pion excess. These conclusions are usually based on a collective theory\n(RPA) of the pions, which may be inadequate. The issue is the energy dependence\nof the nuclear response, which differs for theories with strong NN correlations\nfrom the RPA predictions. In the present paper, information about the energy\ndependence is extracted from sum rules, which are calculated for such a\ncorrelated, noncollective nuclear theory. The results lead to much reduced\nsensitivity of nuclear reactions to the correlations that are responsible for\nthe pion excess. The primary example is $(\\vec p,\\vec n)$ spin transfer, for\nwhich the expected effects are found to be smaller than the experimental\nuncertainties. The analysis has consequences for Deep Inelastic Scattering\n(DIS) experiments as well.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20nu"}
