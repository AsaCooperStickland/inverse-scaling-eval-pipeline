Our approach is purely\noperational: we consider an observer O interrogating a system S with binary\nquestions and define S's state as O's `catalogue of knowledge' about S. From\nthe rules we derive the state spaces for N elementary systems and show that (a)\nthey coincide with the set of density matrices over an N-qubit Hilbert space;\n(b) states evolve unitarily under the group $\\rm{PSU}(2^N)$ according to the\nvon Neumann evolution equation; and (c) O's binary questions correspond to\nprojective Pauli operator measurements with outcome probabilities given by the\nBorn rule. As a by-product, this results in a propositional formulation of\nquantum theory. Aside from offering an informational explanation for the\ntheory's architecture, the reconstruction also unravels new structural\ninsights. We show that, in a derived quadratic information measure, (d) qubits\nsatisfy inequalities which bound the information content in any set of mutually\ncomplementary questions to 1 bit; and (e) maximal sets of mutually\ncomplementary questions for one and two qubits must carry precisely 1 bit of\ninformation in pure states.

Using two complimentary\nvariational approaches, valid for weak interactions, we find rich physics\ndriven by the long range forces. Generically, long range interactions tend to\ndestroy the Meissner phase in favor of modulated density wave phases. Nearest\nneighbor interactions produce a novel interleg charge density wave phase, where\nthe total density remains uniform, but the density on each leg of the ladder is\nmodulating in space, out-of-phase with one another. At weak magnetic fields,\nnext nearest neighbor interactions lead to a fully modulated biased ladder\nphase, where all the particles are on one leg of the ladder, and the density is\nmodulating in space. This state simultaneously breaks $Z_{2}$ reflection\nsymmetry and $U(1)$ symmetry associated with translation in real space. For\nvalues of the flux near $\\phi = \\pi$, we find that a switching effect occurs\nfor arbitrarily weak interactions, where the density modulates in space, but\nthe chiral current changes sign on every plaquette. Arbitrarily weak attractive\ninteractions along the rungs destroy the Meissner phase completely, in favor of\na modulated density wave phase.

First, we show that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy\n$S_{BH}$ may not be a Boltzmann or thermal entropy. To confirm this statement,\nwe show that the original black hole's \"first law\" may not simply be treated as\nthe first law of thermodynamics formally, due to some missing metric\nperturbations caused by matter. Then, by including those (quantum) metric\nperturbations, we show that the black hole formation and evaporation can be\ndescribed in a unitary manner effectively, through a quantum channel between\nthe exterior and interior of the event horizon. In this way, the paradoxes of\ninformation loss and firewall can be resolved effectively.

The quartic nonlinear terms present in the Zakharov\nform of the free surface conditions can cause severe aliasing problems and\nconsequently numerical instability for marginally resolved or very steep waves.\nWe show how the scheme can be stabilised through a combination of\nover-integration of the Galerkin projections and a mild spectral filtering on a\nper element basis.

To test the fidelity of\ngroup catalogue inferred statistics, we run three different group finders used\nin the literature over a mock that includes galaxy colours in a realistic\nmanner. Overall, the resulting mock group catalogues are remarkably similar,\nand most colour-dependent statistics are recovered with reasonable accuracy.\nHowever, it is also clear that certain systematic errors arise as a consequence\nof correlated errors in group membership determination, central/satellite\ndesignation, and halo mass assignment. We introduce a new statistic, the halo\ntransition probability (HTP), which captures the combined impact of all these\nerrors. As a rule of thumb, errors tend to equalize the properties of distinct\ngalaxy populations (i.e. red vs. blue galaxies or centrals vs. satellites), and\nto result in inferred occupation statistics that are more accurate for red\ngalaxies than for blue galaxies. A statistic that is particularly poorly\nrecovered from the group catalogues is the red fraction of central galaxies as\nfunction of halo mass. Group finders do a good job in recovering galactic\nconformity, but also have a tendency to introduce weak conformity when none is\npresent. We conclude that proper inference of colour-dependent statistics from\ngroup catalogues is best achieved using forward modelling (i.e., running group\nfinders over mock data), or by implementing a correction scheme based on the\nHTP, as long as the latter is not too strongly model-dependent.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 12"}

The\nderived asymptotic forms of $T_c$ are categorized into four types, which is\nattributed to the different responses of the degenerate fermions depending on\nthe DOS structures.

{"prompt": "  Recent insights to melt migration beneath ridges suggest that channelized\nflow is a consequence of melting of a heterogeneous mantle, and that spreading\nrate modulates the dynamics of the localized flow. A corollary of this finding\nis that both mantle het- erogeneity and spreading rate have implications for\nthe speed and time scale of melt migration. Here, we investigate these\nimplications using numerical models of magma flow in heterogeneous mantle\nbeneath spreading plates. The models predict that a broad distribution of magma\nflow speeds is characteristic of the sub-ridge mantle. Within the melting\nregion, magmatic flow is fastest in regions of average fusibility;\nsurprisingly, magmas from sources of above-average fusibility travel to the\nridge in a longer time. Spreading rate has comparatively simple consequences,\nmainly resulting in faster segregation speeds at higher spreading rates. The\ncomputed time scales are short enough to preserve deep origin 230Th\ndisequilibria and, under favourable parameter regimes, also 226Ra excesses. An\nimportant prediction from the models is that mantle heterogeneity induces\nsignificant natural variability into U-series disequilibria, complicating the\nidentification of relationships between disequilibria and ridge properties or\nchemical signatures of heterogeneity.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 11"}

Traditional\nobservables, such as the radial surface brightness and second-order velocity\nmoment profiles, are subject to short-term variations due to individual\nepisodes of matter infall and/or star formation. The total mass, energy and\nangular momentum, on the other hand, are approximately conserved.

So far only rough bounds for these parameters have been\nderived for specific problems. This paper sharpens the bounds on these\nstructural parameters for a well-known open problem in the theory of preemptive\nscheduling: Instances consist of in-trees of $n$ unit-execution-time jobs with\nrelease dates, and the objective is to minimize the total completion time on\ntwo processors. This is among the current, tantalizing `threshold' problems of\nscheduling theory: Our literature survey reveals that any significant\ngeneralization leads to an NP-hard problem, but that any significant\nsimplification leads to tractable problem.\n  For the above problem, we show that the number of preemptions necessary for\noptimality need not exceed $2n-1$; that the number must be of order\n$\\Omega(\\log n)$ for some instances; and that the minimum shift need not be\nless than $2^{-2n+1}$. These bounds are obtained by combinatorial analysis of\noptimal schedules rather than by the analysis of polytope corners for\nlinear-program formulations, an approach to be found in earlier papers.

{"prompt": "  Rapidly rotating, low-mass members of eclipsing binary systems have measured\nradii significantly larger than predicted by standard models.

By\nestimating the radii of low-mass stars in three young clusters (NGC 2264, NGC\n2547, NGC 2516, with ages of 5, 35 and 140 Myr respectively), we aim to\nestablish whether similar radius inflation is seen in single, magnetically\nactive stars. We use radial velocities from the Gaia-ESO Survey (GES) and\npublished photometry to establish cluster membership and combine GES\nmeasurements of vsini with published rotation periods to estimate average radii\nfor groups of fast-rotating cluster members as a function of their luminosity\nand age. The average radii are compared with the predictions of both standard\nevolutionary models and variants that include magnetic inhibition of convection\nand starspots. At a given luminosity, the stellar radii in NGC 2516 and NGC\n2547 are larger than predicted by standard evolutionary models at the ages of\nthese clusters. The discrepancy is least pronounced and not significant ~10\npercent) in ZAMS stars with radiative cores, but more significant in\nlower-mass, fully convective pre main-sequence cluster members, reaching\n30+/-10 percent. The uncertain age and distance of NGC 2264 preclude a reliable\ndetermination of any discrepancy for its members. The median radii we have\nestimated for low-mass fully convective stars in the older clusters are\ninconsistent (at the 2-3 sigma level) with non-magnetic evolutionary models and\nmore consistent with models that incorporate the effects of magnetic fields or\ndark starspots. The available models suggest this requires either surface\nmagnetic fields exceeding 2.5 kG, spots that block about 30 per cent of the\nphotospheric flux, or a more moderate combination of both.

{"prompt": "  This paper focuses on low complexity successive cancellation list (SCL)\ndecoding of polar codes. In particular, using the fact that splitting may be\nunnecessary when the reliability of decoding the unfrozen bit is sufficiently\nhigh, a novel splitting rule is proposed. Based on this rule, it is conjectured\nthat, if the correct path survives at some stage, it tends to survive till\ntermination without splitting with high probability. On the other hand, the\nincorrect paths are more likely to split at the following stages. Motivated by\nthese observations, a simple counter that counts the successive number of\nstages without splitting is introduced for each decoding path to facilitate the\nidentification of correct and incorrect path. Specifically, any path with\ncounter value larger than a predefined threshold \\omega is deemed to be the\ncorrect path, which will survive at the decoding stage, while other paths with\ncounter value smaller than the threshold will be pruned, thereby reducing the\ndecoding complexity. Furthermore, it is proved that there exists a unique\nunfrozen bit u_{N-K_1+1}, after which the successive cancellation decoder\nachieves the same error performance as the maximum likelihood decoder if all\nthe prior unfrozen bits are correctly decoded, which enables further complexity\nreduction.

We also show that (i) it is entirely possible that these scalars are\nhidden, apart from this LFV signal; (ii) the signal strengths of $b\\bar{b}$,\n$\\tau^+\\tau^-$ and $\\gamma\\gamma$ around 125 GeV put severe constraints on the\nparameter space of such models; (iii) the constraint is further enhanced by the\nnon-observation of processes like $\\mu\\to e\\gamma$, and we predict that the\nbranching ratio of $\\mu\\to e\\gamma$ cannot be even an order below the present\nexperimental limit, highlighting the role it plays in forcing $H$ and $A$ to be\nnear-degenerate; (iv) an enhancement in the $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ production\ncross-section at around 125 GeV is expected in the gluon fusion channel, and\nshould be observed during the next run of the LHC; (v) the branching ratio in\nthe $e\\tau$ channel is enhanced and is expected to be at least about $2\\%$. The\nconstrained parameter space and minimum number of free parameters, along with\nsuch strong predictions, make this model easily testable and falsifiable.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 17"}
{"prompt": "  We develop the functional renormalization group formalism for a tensorial\ngroup field theory with closure constraint, in the case of an Abelian just\nrenormalizable model with quartic interactions. The method allows us to obtain\na closed but non-autonomous system of differential equations which describe the\nrenormalization group flow of the couplings beyond perturbation theory. The\nexplicit dependence of the beta functions on the running scale is due to the\nexistence of an external scale in the model, the radius of the unit circle. We\nstudy the occurrence of fixed points and their critical properties in two\ndifferent approximate regimes, corresponding to the deep UV and deep IR.\nBesides confirming the asymptotic freedom of the model, we find also a\nnon-trivial fixed point, with one relevant direction. Our results are\nqualitatively similar to those found previously for a rank-3 model without\nclosure constraint, and it is thus tempting to speculate that the presence of a\nWilson-Fisher-like fixed point is a general feature of asymptotically free\ntensorial group field theories.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 10"}
