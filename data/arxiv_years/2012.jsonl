The inclusive charged jet spectrum,\nthe jet nuclear modification factors (R_AA, R_CP), the ratio of spectra\nmeasured with different resolution parameters and hadron-jet correlations are\ndiscussed. For pp data at the same center of mass energy, the inclusive\nspectrum of fully reconstructed jets and its resolution parameter dependence\nare reported.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2012"}
{"prompt": "  Lattice QCD models predict the presence of a critical point in the QCD phase\ndiagram where the first order phase transition between the hadron gas and\nQuark-Gluon Plasma ceases to exist. Higher moments of conserved quantities,\nsuch as net-charge, net-baryon number and net-strangeness, are proposed to be\nsensitive probes for locating the critical point. The moments of net-charge\ndistributions have been studied as a function of centrality for {Au+Au}\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 7.7 to 200 GeV using three event\ngenerators, {\\it viz.}, UrQMD, HIJING, and THERMINATOR-2. The effect of\ncentrality selection, resonance production, as well as contributions from\nparticle species to the net-charge moments and their products have been\nstudied. It is observed that mean of the net-charge distributions are dominated\nby net-protons, whereas standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis closely\nfollow net-pion distributions. These results, along with the predictions from\nHadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model, are presented.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2012"}

{"prompt": "  We study nonlinear states for NLS-type equation with additional periodic\npotential U(x) (called the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, GPE, in theory of\nBose-Einstein Condensate, (BEC)). We prove that if the nonlinearity is\ndefocusing (repulsive, in BEC context) then under certain conditions there\nexists a homeomorphism between the set of nonlinear states for GPE (i.e. real\nbounded solutions of some nonlinear ODE) and the set of bi-infinite sequences\nof numbers from 1 to N for some integer N. These sequences can be viewed as\ncodes of the nonlinear states. Sufficient conditions for the homeomorphism to\nexist are given in the form of three hypotheses. For a given U(x), the\nverification of the hypotheses should be done numerically.

{"prompt": "  This work studies the recursive robust principal components' analysis(PCA)\nproblem. Here, \"robust\" refers to robustness to both independent and correlated\nsparse outliers. If the outlier is the signal-of-interest, this problem can be\ninterpreted as one of recursively recovering a time sequence of sparse vectors,\nSt, in the presence of large but structured noise, Lt. The structure that we\nassume on Lt is that Lt is dense and lies in a low dimensional subspace that is\neither fixed or changes \"slowly enough\". A key application where this problem\noccurs is in video surveillance where the goal is to separate a slowly changing\nbackground (Lt) from moving foreground objects (St) on-the-fly. To solve the\nabove problem, we introduce a novel solution called Recursive Projected CS\n(ReProCS). Under mild assumptions, we show that, with high probability\n(w.h.p.), ReProCS can exactly recover the support set of St at all times; and\nthe reconstruction errors of both St and Lt are upper bounded by a\ntime-invariant and small value at all times.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2012"}

A trion is shown to be unstable with respect to the ground excitonic\nstate and stable with respect to the excited one. So, trions in nanotubes of\nthis type can be formed by capturing an electron or a hole by an excited\nexciton. In other words, the trion in a nanotube is an excimer complex, which\nresults in the formation of a system with three energy levels (unexcited\nexciton--trion--excited exciton).\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2012"}
{"prompt": "  We follow the formation and evolution of bars in N-body simulations of disc\ngalaxies with gas and/or a triaxial halo. We find that both the relative gas\nfraction and the halo shape play a major role in the formation and evolution of\nthe bar. In gas-rich simulations, the disc stays near-axisymmetric much longer\nthan in gas-poor ones, and, when the bar starts growing, it does so at a much\nslower rate. Due to these two effects combined, large-scale bars form much\nlater in gas-rich than in gas-poor discs. This can explain the observation that\nbars are in place earlier in massive red disc galaxies than in blue spirals. We\nalso find that the morphological characteristics in the bar region are strongly\ninfluenced by the gas fraction. In particular, the bar at the end of the\nsimulation is much weaker in gas-rich cases. In no case did we witness bar\ndestruction.\n  Halo triaxiality has a dual influence on bar strength. In the very early\nstages of the simulation it induces bar formation to start earlier. On the\nother hand, during the later, secular evolution phase, triaxial haloes lead to\nconsiderably less increase of the bar strength than spherical ones. The shape\nof the halo evolves considerably with time. The inner halo parts may become\nmore elongated, or more spherical, depending on the bar strength. The main body\nof initially triaxial haloes evolves towards sphericity, but in initially\nstrongly triaxial cases it stops well short of becoming spherical. Part of the\nangular momentum absorbed by the halo generates considerable rotation of the\nhalo particles that stay located relatively near the disc for long periods of\ntime. Another part generates halo bulk rotation, which, contrary to that of the\nbar, increases with time but stays small.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2012"}
{"prompt": "  We present a new Skyrme energy density functional (EDF) named SAMi [Phys.\nRev. C 86 031306(R)]. This interaction has been accurately calibrated to\nreproduce properties of doubly-magic nuclei and infinite nuclear matter. The\nnovelties introduced in the model and fitting protocol of SAMi are crucial for\na better description of the Gamow-Teller Resonance (GTR). Those are, on one\nside, the two-component spin-orbit potential needed for describing different\nproton high-angular momentum spin-orbit splitings and, on the other side, the\ncareful description of the empirical hierarchy and positive values found in\nprevious analysis of the spin (G_0) and spin-isospin (G_0^') Landau-Migdal\nparameters: 0 < G_0 < G_0^', a feature that many of available Skyrme forces\nfail to reproduce. When employed within the self-consistent Hartree-Fock plus\nRandom Phase Approximation, SAMi produces results on ground and excited state\nnuclear properties that are in good agreement with experimental findings. This\nis true not only for the GTR, but also for the Spin Dipole Resonance (SDR) and\nthe Isobaric Analog Resonance (IAR) as well as for the non charge-exchange\nIsoscalar Giant Monopole (ISGMR) and Isovector Giant Dipole (IVGDR) and\nQuadrupole Resonances (IVGQR).\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2012"}
{"prompt": "  The problem of finding groups in data (cluster analysis) has been extensively\nstudied by researchers from the fields of Statistics and Computer Science,\namong others. However, despite its popularity it is widely recognized that the\ninvestigation of some theoretical aspects of clustering has been relatively\nsparse. One of the main reasons for this lack of theoretical results is surely\nthe fact that, unlike the situation with other statistical problems as\nregression or classification, for some of the cluster methodologies it is quite\ndifficult to specify a population goal to which the data-based clustering\nalgorithms should try to get close. This paper aims to provide some insight\ninto the theoretical foundations of the usual nonparametric approach to\nclustering, which understands clusters as regions of high density, by\npresenting an explicit formulation for the ideal population clustering.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2012"}
{"prompt": "  Context: Mode identification is a crucial step to comparing observed\nfrequencies with theoretical ones, but has proven to be difficult in rapidly\nrotating stars.\n  Aims: To further constrain mode identification, we aim to accurately\ncalculate mode visibilities and amplitude ratios in rapid rotators.\n  Methods: We derive the relevant equations for calculating mode visibilities\nin different photometric bands while fully taking into account the geometric\ndistortion from both the centrifugal deformation and the pulsation modes, the\nvariations in effective gravity, and an approximate treatment of the\ntemperature variations. These equations are then applied to 2D oscillation\nmodes, calculated using the TOP code, in fully distorted 2D models based on the\nSCF method. The specific intensities come from a grid of Kurucz atmospheres,\nthereby taking into account limb and gravity darkening.\n  Results: We obtain mode visibilities and amplitude ratios for 2 M_{\\odot}\nmodels rotating at 0 to 80 % of the critical rotation rate. These calculations\nconfirm previous results, such as the increased visibility of chaotic modes,\nthe simpler frequency spectra of pole-on stars, or the dependence of amplitude\nratios on inclination and azimuthal order. In addition, the geometric shape of\nthe star reduces the contrast between pole-on and equator-on visibilities of\nisland modes. We also show that modes with similar (ell, |m|) values frequently\nhave similar amplitude ratios, even in the most rapidly rotating models.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2012"}
