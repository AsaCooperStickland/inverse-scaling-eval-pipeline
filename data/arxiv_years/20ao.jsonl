{"prompt": "  A combination of analytical and numerical techniques are used to efficiently\ndetermine the qualitative and quantitative behaviour of a one-basin zonally\naveraged thermohaline circulation ocean model. In contrast to earlier studies\nwhich use time stepping to find the steady solutions, the steady state\nequations are first solved directly to obtain the multiple equilibria under\nidentical mixed boundary conditions. This approach is based on the\ndifferentiability of the governing equations and especially the convection\nscheme. A linear stability analysis is then performed, in which the normal\nmodes and corresponding eigenvalues are found for the various equilibrium\nstates. Resonant periodic solutions superimposed on these states are predicted\nfor various types of forcing. The results are used to gain insight into the\nsolutions obtained by Mysak, Stocker and Huang in a previous numerical study in\nwhich the eddy diffusivities were varied in a randomly forced one-basin zonally\naveraged model. Resonant stable oscillations with century scale periods are\npredicted with structures that compare favorably with those found in the\nprevious study. In cases with large horizontal diffusivities, the two-cell\npattern is also stable, which parallels cases in the previous study where large\nvacillations were seen between the three stable steady states. Further, in\ncases with large horizontal {\\it and} large vertical diffusivities, no one-cell\npattern can be realised and the only asymptotic behaviour found is the two-cell\npattern.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20ao"}
