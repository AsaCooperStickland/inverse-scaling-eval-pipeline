{"prompt": "  We present a new method for obtaining matched solutions of the rms envelope\nequations. In this approach, the envelope equations are first expressed in\nHamiltonian form. The Hamiltonian defines a nonlinear mapping, $\\cal M$, and\nfor periodic transport systems the fixed points of the one-period map are the\nmatched envelopes. Expanding the Hamiltonian around a fiducial trajectory one\nobtains a linear map, $M$, that describes trajectories (rms envelopes) near the\nfiducial trajectory. Using $\\cal M$ and $M$ we construct a contraction mapping\nthat can be used to obtain the matched envelopes. The algorithm is\nquadratically convergent. Using the zero-current matched parameters as starting\nvalues, the contraction mapping typically converges in a few to several\niterations. Since our approach uses numerical integration to obtain all the\nmappings, it includes the effects of nonidealized, $z$-dependent transverse and\nlongitudinal focusing fields. We present numerical examples including finding a\nmatched beam in a quadrupole channel with rf bunchers.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20ac"}
{"prompt": "  A novel diagnostic method for detecting ordering in one-dimensional ion beams\nis presented. The ions are excited by a pulsed laser at two different positions\nalong the beam and fluorescence is observed by a group of four\nphotomultipliers. Correlation in fluorescence signals is firm indication that\nthe ion beam has an ordered structure.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20ac"}
{"prompt": "  This paper studies the motion of a particle whose tune is inside and near a\nlinear half-integer stopband. Results are found for the tune and beta functions\nin the stable region close to an edge of the stopband. It is shown that the\neigenvalues and the eigenfunctions of the transfer matrix are real inside the\nstopband. All the results found are also valid for small accelerators where the\nlarge accelerator approximation is not used.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20ac"}

Analytical results are obtained for\nboth the irises and the cavities with such a shape which allow simple estimates\nof their broad-band impedances.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20ac"}
