We then assign\nstellar mass profile and velocity dispersion profile parameters to each system\nin the SEC using their observed correlations with M_star and sigma.\nSimultaneously, we solve for dark matter density profile of each halo using the\nspherical Jeans equation. The resulting dark matter density profiles deviate in\ngeneral from the dissipationless profile of NFW or Einasto and their mean inner\ndensity slope and concentration vary systematically with M_vir. Statistical\ntests of the distribution of profiles at fixed M_vir rule out the null\nhypothesis that it follows the distribution predicted by N-body simulations for\nM_vir ~< 10^{13.5-14.5} M_solar. These dark matter profiles imply that dark\nmatter density is, on average, enhanced significantly in the inner region of\nhalos with M_vir ~< 10^{13.5-14.5} M_solar supporting halo contraction. The\nmain characteristics of halo contraction are: (1) the mean dark matter density\nwithin the effective radius has increased by a factor varying systematically up\nto ~ 3-4 at M_vir = 10^{12} M_solar, and (2) the inner density slope has a mean\nof <alpha> ~ 1.3 with rho(r) ~ r^{-alpha} and a halo-to-halo rms scatter of\nrms(alpha) ~ 0.4-0.5 for 10^{12} M_solar ~< M_vir ~< 10^{13-14} M_solar steeper\nthan the NFW profile (alpha=1).

{"prompt": "  Elliptical galaxies contain X-ray emitting gas that is subject to continuous\nram pressure stripping over timescales comparable to cluster ages. The gas in\nthese galaxies is not in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium. Supernova feedback,\nstellar winds, or active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can significantly\nperturb the interstellar medium (ISM). Using hydrodynamical simulations, we\ninvestigate the effect of subsonic turbulence in the hot ISM on the ram\npressure stripping process in early-type galaxies. We find that galaxies with\nmore turbulent ISM produce longer, wider, and more smoothly distributed tails\nof the stripped ISM than those characterised by weaker ISM turbulence. Our main\nconclusion is that even very weak internal turbulence, at the level of <15% of\nthe average ISM sound speed, can significantly accelerate the gas removal from\ngalaxies via ram pressure stripping. The magnitude of this effect increases\nsharply with the strength of turbulence. As most of the gas stripping takes\nplace near the boundary between the ISM and the intraclustermedium (ICM), the\nboost in the ISM stripping rate is due to the \"random walk\" of the ISM from the\ncentral regions of the galactic potential well to larger distances, where the\nram pressure is able to permanently remove the gas from galaxies. The ICM can\nbe temporarily trapped inside the galactic potential well due to the mixing of\nthe turbulent ISM with the ICM. The galaxies with more turbulent ISM, yet still\ncharacterised by very weak turbulence, can hold larger amounts of the ICM.\n[Abridged]\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 10"}

Just the opposite is true: for a set of\ncorrelations there can be given a non-classical common causal explanation even\nif they violate the Bell inequalities. This shows that the range of common\ncausal explanations in the non-classical case is wider than that restricted by\nthe Bell inequalities.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 00"}

The imaging data were corrected for intensity gradients, projection\neffects, and instrumental stray light prior to the analysis. The observations\nshow the formation of a light bridge at one corner of the sunspot by a slow\nintrusion of neighbouring penumbral filaments. This divided the umbra into two\nindividual umbral cores. During the light bridge formation, there was a steep\nincrease in its intensity from 0.28 to 0.7 I_QS in nearly 4 hr, followed by a\ngradual increase to quiet Sun (QS) values in 13 hr. This increase in intensity\nwas accompanied by a large reduction in the field strength from 1800 G to 300\nG. The smaller umbral core gradually broke away from the parent sunspot nearly\n2 days after the formation of the light bridge rendering the parent spot\nwithout a penumbra at the location of fragmentation. The penumbra in the\nfragment disappeared first within 34 hr, followed by the fragment whose area\ndecayed exponentially with a time constant of 22 hr. The depleted penumbra in\nthe parent sunspot regenerated when the inclination of the magnetic field at\nthe penumbra-QS boundary became within 40 deg. from being completely horizontal\nand this occurred near the end of the fragment's lifetime. After the\ndisappearance of the fragment, another light bridge formed in the parent which\nhad similar properties as the fragmenting one, but did not divide the sunspot.\nThe significant weakening in field strength in the light bridge along with the\npresence of granulation is suggestive of strong convection in the sunspot which\nmight have triggered the expulsion and fragmentation of the smaller spot.\nAlthough the presence of QS photospheric conditions in sunspot umbrae could be\na necessary condition for fragmentation, it is not a sufficient one.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 08"}

{"prompt": "  We show that given three hermitian matrices, what one could call a fuzzy\nrepresentation of a membrane, there is a well defined procedure to define a set\nof oriented Riemann surfaces embedded in $R^3$ using an index function defined\nfor points in $R^3$ that is constructed from the three matrices and the point.\nThe set of surfaces is covariant under rotations, dilatations and translation\noperations on $R^3$, it is additive on direct sums and the orientation of the\nsurfaces is reversed by complex conjugation of the matrices. The index we build\nis closely related to the Hanany-Witten effect.

{"prompt": "  Neuronal growth cones are the most sensitive amongst eukaryotic cells in\nresponding to directional chemical cues. Although a dynamic microtubule\ncytoskeleton has been shown to be essential for growth cone turning, the\nprecise nature of coupling of the spatial cue with microtubule polarization is\nless understood. Here we present a computational model of microtubule\npolarization in a turning neuronal growth cone (GC). We explore the limits of\ndirectional cues in modifying the spatial polarization of microtubules by\ntesting the role of microtubule dynamics, gradients of regulators and\nretrograde forces along filopodia. We analyze the steady state and transition\nbehavior of microtubules on being presented with a directional stimulus. The\nmodel makes novel predictions about the minimal angular spread of the chemical\nsignal at the growth cone and the fastest polarization times. A regulatory\nreaction-diffusion network based on the cyclic\nphosphorylation-dephosphorylation of a regulator predicts that the receptor\nsignal magnitude can generate the maximal polarization of microtubules and not\nfeedback loops or amplifications in the network. Using both the\nphenomenological and network models we have demonstrated some of the physical\nlimits within which the MT polarization system works in turning neuron.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 13"}

However, results are still lacking on the\ncollective oscillation period of inter-coupled gene regulatory oscillators,\nwhich, as has been reported, may be different from the oscillation period of an\nautonomous cellular oscillator. Based on the Goodwin oscillator, we analyze the\ncollective oscillation pattern of coupled cellular oscillator networks.

Analytical results are derived\nin terms of biochemical parameters, thus giving insight into the basic\nmechanism of biological oscillation and providing guidance in synthetic biology\ndesign.

{"prompt": "  In this paper, we propose a greedy user selection with swap (GUSS) algorithm\nbased on zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) for the multi-user multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) downlink channels. Since existing user selection\nalgorithms, such as the zero-forcing with selection (ZFS), have `redundant\nuser' and `local optimum' flaws that compromise the achieved sum rate, GUSS\nadds `delete' and `swap' operations to the user selection procedure of ZFS to\nimprove the performance by eliminating `redundant user' and escaping from\n`local optimum', respectively. In addition, an effective channel vector based\neffective-channel-gain updating scheme is presented to reduce the complexity of\nGUSS. With the help of this updating scheme, GUSS has the same order of\ncomplexity of ZFS with only a linear increment. Simulation results indicate\nthat on average GUSS achieves 99.3 percent of the sum rate upper bound that is\nachieved by exhaustive search, over the range of transmit signal-to-noise\nratios considered with only three to six times the complexity of ZFS.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 13"}
{"prompt": "  Feature extraction is a method of capturing visual content of an image.

The Support Vector Machine\n(SVM) classifier served as a comparison of nonlinear techniques Vs linear ones.\nPCA and LDA methods are used to reduce the number of features used.

{"prompt": "  In this paper, the performance limits and the computational complexity of the\nlattice sequential decoder are analyzed for the unconstrained additive white\nGaussian noise channel. The performance analysis available in the literature\nfor such a channel has been studied only under the use of the minimum Euclidean\ndistance decoder that is commonly referred to as the lattice decoder. Lattice\ndecoders based on solutions to the NP-hard closest vector problem are very\ncomplex to implement, and the search for low complexity receivers for the\ndetection of lattice codes is considered a challenging problem. However, the\nlow computational complexity advantage that sequential decoding promises, makes\nit an alternative solution to the lattice decoder. In this work, we will\ncharacterize the performance and complexity tradeoff via the error exponent and\nthe decoding complexity, respectively, of such a decoder as a function of the\ndecoding parameter --- the bias term. For the above channel, we derive the\ncut-off volume-to-noise ratio that is required to achieve a good error\nperformance with low decoding complexity.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 12"}
