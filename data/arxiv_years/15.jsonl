{"prompt": "  We reconstruct the explicit formalism of qubit quantum theory from elementary\nrules on an observer's information acquisition. Our approach is purely\noperational: we consider an observer O interrogating a system S with binary\nquestions and define S's state as O's `catalogue of knowledge' about S. From\nthe rules we derive the state spaces for N elementary systems and show that (a)\nthey coincide with the set of density matrices over an N-qubit Hilbert space;\n(b) states evolve unitarily under the group $\\rm{PSU}(2^N)$ according to the\nvon Neumann evolution equation; and (c) O's binary questions correspond to\nprojective Pauli operator measurements with outcome probabilities given by the\nBorn rule. As a by-product, this results in a propositional formulation of\nquantum theory. Aside from offering an informational explanation for the\ntheory's architecture, the reconstruction also unravels new structural\ninsights. We show that, in a derived quadratic information measure, (d) qubits\nsatisfy inequalities which bound the information content in any set of mutually\ncomplementary questions to 1 bit; and (e) maximal sets of mutually\ncomplementary questions for one and two qubits must carry precisely 1 bit of\ninformation in pure states. The latter relations constitute conserved\ninformational charges which define the unitary groups and, together with their\nconservation conditions, the sets of pure quantum states. These results\nhighlight information as a `charge of quantum theory' and the benefits of this\ninformational approach.

Using two complimentary\nvariational approaches, valid for weak interactions, we find rich physics\ndriven by the long range forces. Generically, long range interactions tend to\ndestroy the Meissner phase in favor of modulated density wave phases. Nearest\nneighbor interactions produce a novel interleg charge density wave phase, where\nthe total density remains uniform, but the density on each leg of the ladder is\nmodulating in space, out-of-phase with one another. At weak magnetic fields,\nnext nearest neighbor interactions lead to a fully modulated biased ladder\nphase, where all the particles are on one leg of the ladder, and the density is\nmodulating in space. This state simultaneously breaks $Z_{2}$ reflection\nsymmetry and $U(1)$ symmetry associated with translation in real space. For\nvalues of the flux near $\\phi = \\pi$, we find that a switching effect occurs\nfor arbitrarily weak interactions, where the density modulates in space, but\nthe chiral current changes sign on every plaquette. Arbitrarily weak attractive\ninteractions along the rungs destroy the Meissner phase completely, in favor of\na modulated density wave phase.

We\nalso show how our technique manages to deliver equally good results in\nreal-time settings, as opposed to having to rely on information not always\nreadily available, such as user ratings and answer scores. We ran an evaluation\non 21 StackExchange websites covering around 4 million questions and more than\n8 million answers.

{"prompt": "  In this paper, we try to construct black hole thermodynamics based on the\nfact that, the formation and evaporation of a black hole can be described by\nquantum unitary evolutions. First, we show that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy\n$S_{BH}$ may not be a Boltzmann or thermal entropy. To confirm this statement,\nwe show that the original black hole's \"first law\" may not simply be treated as\nthe first law of thermodynamics formally, due to some missing metric\nperturbations caused by matter. Then, by including those (quantum) metric\nperturbations, we show that the black hole formation and evaporation can be\ndescribed in a unitary manner effectively, through a quantum channel between\nthe exterior and interior of the event horizon. In this way, the paradoxes of\ninformation loss and firewall can be resolved effectively. Finally, we show\nthat black hole thermodynamics can be constructed in an ordinary way, by\nconstructing statistical mechanics.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}

The quartic nonlinear terms present in the Zakharov\nform of the free surface conditions can cause severe aliasing problems and\nconsequently numerical instability for marginally resolved or very steep waves.\nWe show how the scheme can be stabilised through a combination of\nover-integration of the Galerkin projections and a mild spectral filtering on a\nper element basis. This effectively removes any aliasing driven instabilities\nwhile retaining the high-order accuracy of the numerical scheme. The additional\ncomputational cost of the over-integration is found insignificant compared to\nthe cost of solving the Laplace problem. The model is applied to several\nbenchmark cases in two dimensions.

To test the fidelity of\ngroup catalogue inferred statistics, we run three different group finders used\nin the literature over a mock that includes galaxy colours in a realistic\nmanner. Overall, the resulting mock group catalogues are remarkably similar,\nand most colour-dependent statistics are recovered with reasonable accuracy.\nHowever, it is also clear that certain systematic errors arise as a consequence\nof correlated errors in group membership determination, central/satellite\ndesignation, and halo mass assignment. We introduce a new statistic, the halo\ntransition probability (HTP), which captures the combined impact of all these\nerrors. As a rule of thumb, errors tend to equalize the properties of distinct\ngalaxy populations (i.e. red vs. blue galaxies or centrals vs. satellites), and\nto result in inferred occupation statistics that are more accurate for red\ngalaxies than for blue galaxies. A statistic that is particularly poorly\nrecovered from the group catalogues is the red fraction of central galaxies as\nfunction of halo mass. Group finders do a good job in recovering galactic\nconformity, but also have a tendency to introduce weak conformity when none is\npresent. We conclude that proper inference of colour-dependent statistics from\ngroup catalogues is best achieved using forward modelling (i.e., running group\nfinders over mock data), or by implementing a correction scheme based on the\nHTP, as long as the latter is not too strongly model-dependent.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}

The answer has profound consequences for the\nlong-time quantum correlations within the system. We consider two bosonic modes\ncoupled to a bath. By comparing an exact solution to different Markovian master\nequations, we find that a smooth crossover of the equations-of-motion between\ndominant inter-system and system-bath coupling exists -- but requires a\nnon-secular master equation. We predict a singular behaviour of the dynamics,\nand show that the ultimate failure of non-secular equations of motion is\nessentially a failure of the Markov approximation. Our findings justify the use\nof time-local theories throughout the crossover between system-bath dominated\nand inter-system-coupling dominated dynamics.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}

{"prompt": "  Recent insights to melt migration beneath ridges suggest that channelized\nflow is a consequence of melting of a heterogeneous mantle, and that spreading\nrate modulates the dynamics of the localized flow. A corollary of this finding\nis that both mantle het- erogeneity and spreading rate have implications for\nthe speed and time scale of melt migration. Here, we investigate these\nimplications using numerical models of magma flow in heterogeneous mantle\nbeneath spreading plates. The models predict that a broad distribution of magma\nflow speeds is characteristic of the sub-ridge mantle. Within the melting\nregion, magmatic flow is fastest in regions of average fusibility;\nsurprisingly, magmas from sources of above-average fusibility travel to the\nridge in a longer time. Spreading rate has comparatively simple consequences,\nmainly resulting in faster segregation speeds at higher spreading rates. The\ncomputed time scales are short enough to preserve deep origin 230Th\ndisequilibria and, under favourable parameter regimes, also 226Ra excesses. An\nimportant prediction from the models is that mantle heterogeneity induces\nsignificant natural variability into U-series disequilibria, complicating the\nidentification of relationships between disequilibria and ridge properties or\nchemical signatures of heterogeneity.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}

So far only rough bounds for these parameters have been\nderived for specific problems. This paper sharpens the bounds on these\nstructural parameters for a well-known open problem in the theory of preemptive\nscheduling: Instances consist of in-trees of $n$ unit-execution-time jobs with\nrelease dates, and the objective is to minimize the total completion time on\ntwo processors. This is among the current, tantalizing `threshold' problems of\nscheduling theory: Our literature survey reveals that any significant\ngeneralization leads to an NP-hard problem, but that any significant\nsimplification leads to tractable problem.\n  For the above problem, we show that the number of preemptions necessary for\noptimality need not exceed $2n-1$; that the number must be of order\n$\\Omega(\\log n)$ for some instances; and that the minimum shift need not be\nless than $2^{-2n+1}$. These bounds are obtained by combinatorial analysis of\noptimal schedules rather than by the analysis of polytope corners for\nlinear-program formulations, an approach to be found in earlier papers. The\nbounds immediately follow from a fundamental structural property called\n`normality', by which minimal shifts of a job are exponentially decreasing\nfunctions. In particular, the first interval between a preempted job's start\nand its preemption is a multiple of 1/2, the second such interval is a multiple\nof 1/4, and in general, the $i$-th preemption occurs at a multiple of $2^{-i}$.\nWe expect the new structural properties to play a prominent role in finally\nsettling a vexing, still-open question of complexity.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}

Adopting the framework\nof cold magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), we model coronal loops as magnetized\ncylinders with a transverse equilibrium density profile comprising a monolithic\npart and a modulation due to fine structuring in the form of concentric shells.\nThe equation governing the transverse velocity perturbation is solved with an\ninitial-value-problem approach, and the effects of fine structuring on the\nperiods $P$ and damping times $\\tau$ of global, leaky, standing sausage modes\nare examined. A parameter study shows that fine structuring, be it periodically\nor randomly distributed, brings changes of only a few percent to $P$ and $\\tau$\nwhen there are more than about ten shells. The monolithic part, its steepness\nin particular, plays a far more important role in determining $P$ and $\\tau$.\nWe conclude that when measured values of $P$ and $\\tau$ of sausage modes are\nused for seismological purposes, it is justified to use theoretical results\nwhere the effects due to fine structuring are neglected.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}

{"prompt": "  This paper focuses on low complexity successive cancellation list (SCL)\ndecoding of polar codes. In particular, using the fact that splitting may be\nunnecessary when the reliability of decoding the unfrozen bit is sufficiently\nhigh, a novel splitting rule is proposed. Based on this rule, it is conjectured\nthat, if the correct path survives at some stage, it tends to survive till\ntermination without splitting with high probability. On the other hand, the\nincorrect paths are more likely to split at the following stages. Motivated by\nthese observations, a simple counter that counts the successive number of\nstages without splitting is introduced for each decoding path to facilitate the\nidentification of correct and incorrect path. Specifically, any path with\ncounter value larger than a predefined threshold \\omega is deemed to be the\ncorrect path, which will survive at the decoding stage, while other paths with\ncounter value smaller than the threshold will be pruned, thereby reducing the\ndecoding complexity. Furthermore, it is proved that there exists a unique\nunfrozen bit u_{N-K_1+1}, after which the successive cancellation decoder\nachieves the same error performance as the maximum likelihood decoder if all\nthe prior unfrozen bits are correctly decoded, which enables further complexity\nreduction.

Recently major\nnew observational results have impacted our use of the relatively limited\nhistorical record in new ways: the detection of actual events in the $^{14}$C\ntree-ring records, and the systematic observations of flares and \"superflares\"\nby the Kepler spacecraft. I discuss how these new findings may affect our\nunderstanding of the distribution function expected for extreme solar events.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}

{"prompt": "  The primordial internal structures of gas giant planets are unknown. Often\ngiant planets are modeled under the assumption that they are adiabatic,\nconvective, and homogeneously mixed, but this is not necessarily correct. In\nthis work, we present the first self-consistent calculation of convective\ntransport of both heat and material as the planets evolve. We examine how\nplanetary evolution depends on the initial composition and its distribution,\nwhether the internal structure changes with time, and if so, how it affects the\nevolution. We consider various primordial distributions, different\ncompositions, and different mixing efficiencies and follow the distribution of\nheavy elements in a Jupiter-mass planet as it evolves. We show that a\nheavy-element core cannot be eroded by convection if there is a sharp\ncompositional change at the core-envelope boundary. If the heavy elements are\ninitially distributed within the planet according to some compositional\ngradient, mixing occurs in the outer regions resulting in a compositionally\nhomogeneous outer envelope. Mixing of heavy materials that are injected in a\nconvective gaseous envelope are found to mix efficiently. Our work demonstrates\nthat the primordial internal structure of a giant planet plays a substantial\nrole in determining its long-term evolution and that giant planets can have\nnon-adiabatic interiors.

{"prompt": "  Quantum tensor network states and more particularly projected entangled-pair\nstates provide a natural framework for representing ground states of gapped,\ntopologically ordered systems. The defining feature of these representations is\nthat topological order is a consequence of the symmetry of the underlying\ntensors in terms of matrix product operators. In this paper, we present a\nsystematic study of those matrix product operators, and show how this relates\nentanglement properties of projected entangled-pair states to the formalism of\nfusion tensor categories. From the matrix product operators we construct a\nC*-algebra and find that topological sectors can be identified with the central\nidempotents of this algebra. This allows us to construct projected\nentangled-pair states containing an arbitrary number of anyons. Properties such\nas topological spin, the S matrix, fusion and braiding relations can readily be\nextracted from the idempotents. As the matrix product operator symmetries are\nacting purely on the virtual level of the tensor network, the ensuing Wilson\nloops are not fattened when perturbing the system, and this opens up the\npossibility of simulating topological theories away from renormalization group\nfixed points.

These effects relate to\nthe enhancement or depletion, respectively, in coronal abundance with respect\nto photospheric values of elements with FIP below about 10~eV. They are\ninterpreted in terms of the ponderomotive force due to the propagation and/or\nreflection of magnetohydrodynamic waves in the chromosphere. This acts on\nchromospheric ions, but not neutrals, and so can lead to ion-neutral\nfractionation.\n  A detailed description of the model applied to closed magnetic loops, and to\nopen field regions is given, accounting for the observed difference in solar\nFIP fractionation between the slow and fast wind. It is shown that such a model\ncan also account for the observed depletion of helium in the solar wind. The\nhelium depletion is sensitive to the chromospheric altitude where ion-neutral\nseparation occurs, and the behavior of the helium abundance in the closed\nmagnetic loop strongly suggests that the waves have a coronal origin. This, and\nother similar inferences may be expected to have a strong bearing on theories\nof solar coronal heating.\n  Chromospheric waves originating from below as acoustic waves mode convert,\nmainly to fast mode waves, can also give rise to ion-neutral separation.\nDepending on the geometry of the magnetic field, this can result in FIP or\nInverse FIP effects.

These pair correlations give rise\nto a molecule pole of the cross section at negative energy on the BEC side of\nthe resonance, which smoothly evolves into a resonance at positive scattering\nenergy with a non-zero imaginary part on the BCS side. The resonance is the\nanalogue of superfluid pairing for the corresponding population balanced\nsystem. Using Fermi liquid theory, we then show that the low temperature\nscattering rate of the impurity atom is significantly increased due to these\npair correlations for low momenta. We demonstrate that finite range and mass\nimbalance effects are significant for the experimentally relevant\n$^6$Li-$^{40}$K mixture, and we finally discuss how the scattering rate can be\nmeasured using radio-frequency spectroscopy and Bose-Fermi mixtures.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}

We show that for an\ninfinite discrete set of critical values of $h_e$, the long-time energy growth\nrate is universal and of order of unity (`metallic' phase), but otherwise\nvanishes (`insulating' phase). Moreover, the rotor insulating phases are\ntopological, each of which is characterized by a hidden quantum number. This\nnumber exhibits universal behavior for small $h_e$, i.e., it jumps by unity\nwhenever $h_e$ decreases, passing through each critical value. This intriguing\nphenomenon is not triggered by the like of Landau band filling, well-known to\nbe the mechanism for conventional IQHE, and far beyond the canonical\nThouless-Kohmoto-Nightingale-Nijs paradigm for quantum Hall transitions.\nInstead, this dynamical phenomenon is of strong chaos origin; it does not occur\nwhen the dynamics is (partially) regular.

Since our problem subsumes the classical constrained robust\noptimal control design problem, it is computationally intractable in general.\nWe demonstrate that by restricting the families of admissible uncertainty sets\nand control policies, the problem can be formulated as a tractable convex\noptimization problem. We show that our framework captures several families of\n(convex) uncertainty sets of practical interest, and illustrate our approach on\na demand response problem of providing control reserves for a power system.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}

Building on the fruitful\nanalogy introduced between spins/quantum bits and nanomechanical modes, we\nreport on the methods available to define pure dephasing in these systems,\nwhile demonstrating the intrinsic almost-ideal properties of silicon-nitride\nbeams. These experimental and theoretical results, at the boundary between\nclassical nanomechanics and quantum information fields, are prerequisite in the\nunderstanding of decoherence processes in mechanical devices, both classical\nand quantum.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}

First\nwe conduct a 2D hydrodynamical simulation to follow the long-term protostellar\naccretion until the stellar mass exceeds $10^4~M_\\odot$. The disc fragments due\nto gravitational instability, creating a number of small clumps that rapidly\nmigrate inward to fall onto the star.

We show that the circumstellar disc for the\nso-called direct collapse model is more unstable and generates greater\nvariability over shorter timescales than normal Pop III cases. We conduct a\npost-process stellar evolution calculation using the obtained accretion\nhistory. Our results show that, regardless of the strong variability of the\naccretion rates, the stellar radius monotonically increases with almost\nconstant effective temperature at $T_{\\rm eff} \\simeq 5000$ K as the stellar\nmass increases. The resulting UV feedback is too weak to hinder mass accretion\ndue to the low flux of stellar UV photons, thus verifying our implicit\nassumption of no stellar feedback during the hydrodynamic simulations.

The\nsystem identification problem, in its new form, is identical to the problem of\nobtaining the signal matched synthesis filter bank (SMSFB) as proposed in Part\nII. Since we have developed fast algorithms to obtain the filter bank\ncoefficients in Part II, for \"the given data case\" as well as \"the given\nstatistics case\", we can use these algorithm for the MIMO system identification\nas well.

The statistical physics of this process\nhas a long history, and is commonly described in term of the Poland-Scheraga\n(PS) model. Crucial to this model is the configurational entropy for a melted\nregion (compared to the entropy of an intact region of the same size),\nquantified by the loop factor. In this study we investigate how confinement\naffects the DNA melting transition, by using the loop factor for an ideal\nGaussian chain. By subsequent numerical solutions of the PS model, we\ndemonstrate that the melting temperature depends on the persistence lengths of\nsingle-stranded and double-stranded DNA. For realistic values of the\npersistence lengths the melting temperature is predicted to decrease with\ndecreasing channel diameter. We also demonstrate that confinement broadens the\nmelting transition. These general findings hold for the three scenarios\ninvestigated: namely 1. homo-DNA, i.e. identical basepairs along the DNA\nmolecule; 2. random sequence DNA, and 3. \"real\" DNA, here T4 phage DNA. We show\nthat cases 2 and 3 in general give rise to broader transitions than case 1.\nCase 3 exhibits a similar phase transition as case 2 provided the random\nsequence DNA has the same ratio of AT to GC basepairs. A simple analytical\nestimate for the shift in melting temperature is provided as a function of\nnanochannel diameter.

In this paper, we propose an adaptive channel\naccess algorithm for wireless communications in unknown environments based on\nthe theory of multi-armed bandits (MAB) problems. By automatically tuning two\ncontrol parameters, i.e., learning rate and exploration probability, our\nalgorithms are capable of finding the optimal channel access strategies and\nachieving the almost optimal learning performance over time under our defined\nfour typical regimes for general unknown environments, e.g., the stochastic\nregime where channels follow some unknown i.i.d process, the adversarial regime\nwhere all channels are suffered by adversarial jamming attack, the mixed\nstochastic and adversarial regime where a subset of channels are attacked and\nthe contaminated stochastic regime where occasionally adversarial events\ncontaminate the stochastic channel process, etc. To reduce the implementation\ntime and space complexity, we further develop an enhanced algorithm by\nexploiting the internal structure of the selection of channel access strategy.\nWe conduct extensive simulations in all these regimes to validate our\ntheoretical analysis.

For open strings,\nwe illustrate that surface contributions to the higher spin fields correspond\nto open strings piercing the Rindler origin, unifying the higher spin surface\ncontributions in string language. For closed strings, we demonstrate that the\nstring partition function is not quite the same as the sum over the partition\nfunctions of the fields in the spectrum: an infinite overcounting is present\nfor the latter.

In\nthis paper, we analyze the so-called big parsimony problem under these two\nconcepts, i.e. we investigate maximum parsimonious networks and analyze their\nproperties. In particular, we show that finding a softwired maximum parsimony\nnetwork is possible in polynomial time. We also show that the set of maximum\nparsimony networks for the hardwired definition always contains at least one\nphylogenetic tree.

{"prompt": "  Most of the distributed protocols for multi-agent consensus assume that the\nagents are mutually cooperative and \"trustful,\" and so the couplings among the\nagents bring the values of their states closer. Opinion dynamics in social\ngroups, however, require beyond these conventional models due to ubiquitous\ncompetition and distrust between some pairs of agents, which are usually\ncharacterized by repulsive couplings and may lead to clustering of the\nopinions. A simple yet insightful model of opinion dynamics with both\nattractive and repulsive couplings was proposed recently by C. Altafini, who\nexamined first-order consensus algorithms over static signed graphs. This\nprotocol establishes modulus consensus, where the opinions become the same in\nmodulus but may differ in signs.

The atmosphere affects the measured Cherenkov\nyield in several ways: the air-shower development itself, the variation of the\nCherenkov angle with altitude, the loss of photons due to scattering and\nabsorption of Cherenkov light out of the camera field-of-view and the\nscattering of photons into the camera. In this scenario, aerosols are the most\nvariable atmospheric component in time and space and therefore need a\ncontinuous monitoring. Lidars are among the most used instruments in\natmospheric physics to measure the aerosol attenuation profiles of light. The\nARCADE Lidar system is a very compact and portable Raman Lidar system that has\nbeen built within the FIRB 2010 grant and is currently taking data in Lamar,\nColorado. The ARCADE Lidar is proposed to operate at the CTA sites with the\ngoal of making a first survey of the aerosol conditions of the selected site\nand to use it as a calibrated benchmark for the other Lidars that will be\ninstalled on site. It is proposed for CTA that the ARCADE Lidar will be first\nupgraded in Italy and then tested in parallel to a Lidar of the EARLINET\nnetwork in L'Aquila. Upgrades include the addition of the water vapour Raman\nchannel to the receiver and the use of new and better performing electronics.\nIt is proposed that the upgraded system will travel to and characterize both\nCTA sites, starting from the first selected site in 2016.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}
{"prompt": "  For more than 100 years, one of the central concepts in statistical mechanics\nhas been the microcanonical ensemble, which provides a way of calculating the\nthermodynamic entropy for a specified energy. A controversy has recently\nemerged between two distinct definitions of the entropy based on the\nmicrocanonical ensemble: (1) The Boltzmann entropy, defined by the density of\nstates at a specified energy, and (2) The Gibbs entropy, defined by the sum or\nintegral of the density of states below a specified energy. A critical\ndifference between the consequences of these definitions pertains to the\nconcept of negative temperatures, which by the Gibbs definition, cannot exist.\nIn this paper, we call into question the fundamental assumption that the\nmicrocanonical ensemble should be used to define the entropy. Our argument is\nbased on a recently proposed canonical definition of the entropy as a function\nof energy. We investigate the predictions of the Boltzmann, Gibbs, and\ncanonical definitions for a variety of classical and quantum models, including\nmodels which exhibit a first-order phase transition. Our results support the\nvalidity of the concept of negative temperature, but not for all models with a\ndecreasing density of states.

Two massive starless core candidates, C1-N & C1-S, have been\ndetected in IRDC G028.37+00.07 in $\\rm N_2D^+$(3-2) with $ALMA$. From their\nline widths, either the cores are subvirial and are thus young structures on\nthe verge of near free-fall collapse, or they are threaded by $\\sim1$ mG\n$B$-fields that help support them in near virial equilibrium and potentially\nhave older ages.

First, to measure their current deuterium\nfraction, $D_{\\rm\n  frac}^{\\rm N_2H^+}$ $\\equiv [\\rm N_2D^+]/[N_2H^+]$, we observed multiple\ntransitions of $\\rm N_2H^+$ and $\\rm N_2D^+$ with $CARMA$, $SMA$, $JCMT$,\n$NRO~45m$ and $IRAM~30m$, to complement the $ALMA$ data.

To\nreach the observed $D_{\\rm frac}^{\\rm\n  N_2H^+}$, most models require slow collapse with $\\alpha_{\\rm\n  ff}\\sim0.1$, i.e., $\\sim1/10$th of free-fall.

{"prompt": "  The equivalence of thermodynamic ensembles is at the heart of statistical\nmechanics and central to our understanding of equilibrium states of matter.\nRecently, it has been shown that there is a formal connection between the\ndynamics of open quantum systems and the statistical mechanics in an extra\ndimension. This is established through the fact that an open system dynamics\ngenerates a Matrix Product state (MPS) which encodes the set of all possible\nquantum jump trajectories and permits the construction of generating functions\nin the spirit of thermodynamic partition functions. In the case of\ncontinuous-time Markovian evolution, such as that generated by a Lindblad\nmaster equation, the corresponding MPS is a so-called continuous MPS which\nencodes the set of continuous measurement records terminated at some fixed\ntotal observation time. Here we show that if one instead terminates\ntrajectories after a fixed total number of quantum jumps, e.g. emission events\ninto the environment, the associated MPS is discrete. This establishes an\ninteresting analogy: The continuous and discrete MPS correspond to different\nensembles of quantum trajectories, one characterised by total time the other by\ntotal number of quantum jumps. Hence they give rise to quantum versions of\ndifferent thermodynamic ensembles, akin to \"grand-canonical\" and \"isobaric\",\nbut for trajectories. Here we prove that these trajectory ensembles are\nequivalent in a suitable limit of long time or large number of jumps. This is\nin direct analogy to equilibrium statistical mechanics where equivalence\nbetween ensembles is only strictly established in the thermodynamic limit. An\nintrinsic quantum feature is that the equivalence holds only for all\nobservables that commute with the number of quantum jumps.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}

{"prompt": "  The parameters of a linear compartment model are usually estimated from\nexperimental input-output data. A problem arises when infinitely many parameter\nvalues can yield the same result; such a model is called unidentifiable. In\nthis case, one can search for an identifiable reparametrization of the model: a\nmap which reduces the number of parameters, such that the reduced model is\nidentifiable. We study a specific class of models which are known to be\nunidentifiable. Using algebraic geometry and graph theory, we translate a\ncriterion given by Meshkat and Sullivant for the existence of an identifiable\nscaling reparametrization to a new criterion based on the rank of a weighted\nadjacency matrix of a certain bipartite graph. This allows us to derive several\nnew constructions to obtain graphs with an identifiable scaling\nreparametrization. Using these constructions, a large subclass of such graphs\nis obtained. Finally, we present a procedure of subdividing or deleting edges\nto ensure that a model has an identifiable scaling reparametrization.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}

The key idea is to make use of the $t$- or\n($t$-$\\phi$)-reflection isometry, $i$, of the background spacetime and\ndecompose the initial data for perturbations into their odd and even parts\nunder $i$. We then write the canonical energy as $\\mathscr E\\ = \\mathscr K +\n\\mathscr U$, where $\\mathscr K$ and $\\mathscr U$, respectively, denote the\ncanonical energy of the odd part (kinetic energy) and even part (potential\nenergy).

Here we\nshow that instantaneous events such as the release of news items via Twitter,\ncoupled with active community arguments related to the news item form a\nparticular type of small-world network. Analysis of the centralities in the\nnetwork reveals that community arguments maintain the small-world network\nwhilst actively maintaining the cohesiveness and boundary of the group. The\nresults demonstrate how an active Twitter community unconsciously forms a\nsmall-world network whilst interacting locally with a bordering community. Over\ntime, such local interactions brought about the global emergence of the\nsmall-world network, connecting media channels with human activities.\nUnderstanding the small-world phenomenon in relation to online social or civic\nmovement is important, as evident in the spate of online activists that tipped\nthe power of governments for the better or worst in recent times. The support,\nor removal of high centrality nodes in such networks has important\nramifications in the self-expression of society and civic discourses. The\npresentation in this article anticipates further exploration of man-made\nself-organising systems where a larger cluster of ad-hoc and active community\nmaintains the overall cohesiveness of the network.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}

{"prompt": "  Currently, Eulerian flow solvers are very efficient in accurately resolving\nflow structures near solid boundaries. On the other hand, they tend to be\ndiffusive and to dampen high-intensity vortical structures after a short\ndistance away from solid boundaries. The use of high order methods and fine\ngrids, although alleviating this problem, gives rise to large systems of\nequations that are expensive to solve.\n  Lagrangian solvers, as the regularized vortex particle method, have shown to\neliminate (in practice) the diffusion in the wake. As a drawback, the modelling\nof solid boundaries is less accurate, more complex and costly than with\nEulerian solvers (due to the isotropy of its computational elements).\n  Given the drawbacks and advantages of both Eulerian and Lagrangian solvers\nthe combination of both methods, giving rise to a hybrid solver, is\nadvantageous. The main idea behind the hybrid solver presented is the\nfollowing. In a region close to solid boundaries the flow is solved with an\nEulerian solver, where the full Navier-Stokes equations are solved (possibly\nwith an arbitrary turbulence model or DNS, the limitations being the\ncomputational power and the physical properties of the flow), outside of that\nregion the flow is solved with a vortex particle method.\n  In this work we present this hybrid scheme and verify it numerically on known\n2D benchmark cases: dipole flow, flow around a cylinder and flow around a\nstalled airfoil. The success in modelling these flow conditions presents this\nhybrid approach as a promising alternative, bridging the gap between highly\nresolved and computationally intensive Eulerian CFD simulations and fast but\nless resolved Lagrangian simulations.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}

All PPS paradoxes, such as the 3-box paradox, the Quantum Cheshire Cat,\nand the Quantum Pigeonhole principle, construct a particular type of\nontological model that assigns an eigenvalue to each observable (independent of\ncontext) of a system such that these assignments are consistent with the PPS.\nIt is shown that such an ontological model must be explicitly contextual in the\nsense of the KS theorem, or otherwise implies either a restriction on free\nrandom choice or explicitly retrocausal behavior. We call such models\nPPS-contextual. The structure of each paradox is always such that there are\nparticular contexts of mutually commuting observables that violate the product\nrule or sum rule, when the ontological model is extended to include observables\nthat are not measured during the experiment. These paradoxes are\ncounterfactual, in the sense that they are not directly observed, and also\nbecause the product and sum rules are always obeyed by projective measurements\nin actual experiments. It is shown that by adopting an alternate ontological\nmodel, where all hidden variables are weak values (which are not always\neigenvalues, but obey the sum rule by definition), the same contexts that\npresented the original paradox must also contain observables with anomalous\nweak values. These anomalous weak values are not counterfactual because they\ncan be probed through weak measurements on an ensemble of identically pre- and\npost-selected states, allowing this localized signature of KS contextuality to\nbe experimentally observed. The weak values of all observables of a system can\nin principle be measured during an experiment, making this model a promising\ncandidate for describing PPS-contextual ontological `elements of reality.'\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}

{"prompt": "  Variable selection is a fundamental task in statistical data analysis.\nSparsity-inducing regularization methods are a popular class of methods that\nsimultaneously perform variable selection and model estimation. The central\nproblem is a quadratic optimization problem with an l0-norm penalty. Exactly\nenforcing the l0-norm penalty is computationally intractable for larger scale\nproblems, so dif- ferent sparsity-inducing penalty functions that approximate\nthe l0-norm have been introduced. In this paper, we show that viewing the\nproblem from a convex relaxation perspective offers new insights. In\nparticular, we show that a popular sparsity-inducing concave penalty function\nknown as the Minimax Concave Penalty (MCP), and the reverse Huber penalty\nderived in a recent work by Pilanci, Wainwright and Ghaoui, can both be derived\nas special cases of a lifted convex relaxation called the perspective\nrelaxation. The optimal perspective relaxation is a related minimax problem\nthat balances the overall convexity and tightness of approximation to the l0\nnorm.

Moreover, a\nprobabilistic interpretation of the semidefinite relaxation reveals connections\nwith the boolean quadric polytope in combinatorial optimization. Finally by\nreformulating the l0-norm pe- nalized problem as a two-level problem, with the\ninner level being a Max-Cut problem, our proposed semidefinite relaxation can\nbe realized by replacing the inner level problem with its semidefinite\nrelaxation studied by Goemans and Williamson.

As a\nconsequence, the surface spectral function becomes weaker, but retains its\nquasiparticle peak. This is in contrast to Gaussian disorder, which smears out\nthe quasiparticle peak completely. At the surface of Bi$_2$Se$_3$, the effects\nof Gaussian disorder can be reduced by removing surface adsorbates using neon\nsputtering, which, however, introduces unitary scatterers. Since unitary\ndisorder has a weaker effect than Gaussian disorder, the ARPES signal of the\nDirac surface state becomes sharper upon sputtering.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}

Quantum memories with\nhigh storage capacities are one such example which require long-lived states\nthat can be addressed and manipulated coherently within the inhomogeneously\nbroadened ensemble. This broadening is essential for true multimode memories,\nbut induces a considerable spin dephasing and together with dissipation from a\ncavity interface poses a constraint on the memory's storage time. In this work\nwe show how to overcome both of these limitations through the engineering of\nlong-lived dark states in an ensemble of electron spins hosted by\nnitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond. By burning narrow spectral holes into a\nspin ensemble strongly coupled to a superconducting microwave cavity, we\nobserve long-lived Rabi oscillations with high visibility and a decay rate that\nis a factor of forty smaller than the spin ensemble linewidth and thereby a\nfactor of more than three below the pure cavity dissipation rate.

However, these quantities are hard to compute, motivating the\nsearch for upper bounds. Takeoka, Guha and Wilde found the squashed\nentanglement of a quantum channel to be an upper bound on both these\ncapacities. In general it is still hard to find the exact value of the squashed\nentanglement of a quantum channel, but clever sub-optimal squashing channels\nallow one to upper bound this quantity, and thus also the corresponding\ncapacities.

In particular, our bound is applicable to\nthe realistic scenario when there is a restriction on the mean photon number on\nthe input.

The studies, however,\nhave been so far mainly focused on a particular type of SOI, known as Rashba\nSOI, whereby the electron spin is locked to its momentum at a right-angle,\nthereby leading to an in-planar helical spin texture. Here we discuss\nelectric-field-induced superconductivity in molybdenum disulphide (MoS2), which\nexhibits a fundamentally different type of intrinsic SOI manifested by an\nout-of-plane Zeeman-type spin polarization of energy valleys. We find an upper\ncritical field of approximately 52 T at 1.5 K, which indicates an enhancement\nof the Pauli limit by a factor of four as compared to that in centrosymmetric\nconventional superconductors. Using realistic tight-binding calculations, we\nreveal that this unusual behaviour is due to an inter-valley pairing that is\nsymmetrically protected by Zeeman-type spin-valley locking against external\nmagnetic fields. Our study sheds a new light on the interplay of inversion\nasymmetry with SOI in confined geometries, and its unprecedented role in\nsuperconductivity.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}
{"prompt": "  We derive several uncertainty relations for two arbitrary unitary operators\nacting on physical states of a Hilbert space. We show that our bounds are\ntighter in various cases than the ones existing in the current literature.\nUsing the uncertainty relation for the unitary operators, we obtain the tight\nstate-independent lower bound for the uncertainty of two Pauli observables and\nanticommuting observables in higher dimensions. With regard to the\nminimum-uncertainty states, we derive the minimum-uncertainty state equation by\nthe analytic method and relate this to the ground-state problem of the Harper\nHamiltonian. Furthermore, the higher-dimensional limit of the uncertainty\nrelations and minimum-uncertainty states are explored. From an operational\npoint of view, we show that the uncertainty in the unitary operator is directly\nrelated to the visibility of quantum interference in an interferometer where\none arm of the interferometer is affected by a unitary operator. This shows a\nprinciple of preparation uncertainty, i.e., for any quantum system, the amount\nof visibility for two general noncommuting unitary operators is nontrivially\nupper bounded.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}

{"prompt": "  Most of super-Earths detected by the radial velocity (RV) method have\nsignificantly smaller eccentricities than the eccentricities corresponding to\nvelocity dispersion equal to their surface escape velocity (\"escape\neccentricities\"). If orbital instability followed by giant impacts among\nprotoplanets that have migrated from outer region is considered, it is usually\nconsidered that eccentricities of the merged bodies become comparable to those\nof orbital crossing bodies, which are excited up to their escape eccentricities\nby close scattering. However, the eccentricity evolution in the {\\it in situ}\naccretion model has not been studied in detail. Here, we investigate the\neccentricity evolution through {\\it N}-body simulations. We have found that the\nmerged planets tend to have much smaller eccentricities than the escape\neccentricities due to very efficient collision damping. If the protoplanet\norbits are initially well separated and their eccentricities are securely\nincreased, an inner protoplanet collides at its apocenter with an outer\nprotoplanet at its pericenter. The eccentricity of the merged body is the\nsmallest for such configuration. Orbital inclinations are also damped by this\nmechanism and planets tend to share a same orbital plane, which is consistent\nwith {\\it Kepler} data. Such efficient collision damping is not found when we\nstart calculations from densely packed orbits of the protoplanets.

In particular, the prediction of energy consumption in\nbuilding is essential for the energy operator to build an optimal operating\nstrategy, which could be integrated to building's energy management system\n(BEMS). This paper proposes a prediction model for building energy consumption\nusing support vector machine (SVM). Data-driven model, for instance, SVM is\nvery sensitive to the selection of training data. Thus the relevant days data\nselection method based on Dynamic Time Warping is used to train SVM model.

The results showed that support vector machine\nbased on relevant data selection method is able to predict the energy\nconsumption of building with a high accuracy in compare to whole data training.\nIn addition, relevant data selection method is computationally cheaper (around\n8 minute training time) in contrast to whole data training (around 31 hour for\nweekend and 116 hour for working days) and reveals realistic control\nimplementation for online system as well.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}

Any such area bias could alter CMB cosmology, and\nthe corresponding bias in mean flux density could affect supernova cosmology.\nHere we show that, in an ensemble averaged sense, the perturbation to the area\nof a surface of constant redshift is in reality much smaller, being on the\norder of the cumulative bending angle squared, or roughly a part-in-a-million\neffect. This validates the arguments of Weinberg (1976) that the mean\nmagnification $\\mu$ of sources is unity and of Kibble \\& Lieu (2005) that the\nmean direction-averaged inverse magnification is unity.

{"prompt": "  We report on high resolution measurements of resonances in the spectrum of\ncoherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) at the Canadian Light Source (CLS). The\nresonances permeate the spectrum at wavenumber intervals of $0.074\n~\\textrm{cm}^{-1}$, and are highly stable under changes in the machine setup\n(energy, bucket filling pattern, CSR in bursting or continuous mode). Analogous\nresonances were predicted long ago in an idealized theory as eigenmodes of a\nsmooth toroidal vacuum chamber driven by a bunched beam moving on a circular\norbit. A corollary of peaks in the spectrum is the presence of pulses in the\nwakefield of the bunch at well defined spatial intervals. Through experiments\nand further calculations we elucidate the resonance and wakefield mechanisms in\nthe CLS vacuum chamber, which has a fluted form much different from a smooth\ntorus. The wakefield is observed directly in the 30-110 GHz range by RF diodes,\nand indirectly by an interferometer in the THz range. The wake pulse sequence\nfound by diodes is less regular than in the toroidal model, and depends on the\npoint of observation, but is accounted for in a simulation of fields in the\nfluted chamber. Attention is paid to polarization of the observed fields, and\npossible coherence of fields produced in adjacent bending magnets. Low\nfrequency wakefield production appears to be mainly local in a single bend, but\nmulti-bend effects cannot be excluded entirely, and could play a role in high\nfrequency resonances. New simulation techniques have been developed, which\nshould be invaluable in further work.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}

{"prompt": "  We develop a Boltzmann-Langevin description of Coulomb drag effect in clean\ndouble-layer systems with large interlayer separation $d$ as compared to the\naverage interelectron distance $\\lambda_F$. Coulomb drag arises from density\nfluctuations with spatial scales of order $d$. At low temperatures, their\ncharacteristic frequencies exceed the intralayer equilibration rate of the\nelectron liquid, and Coulomb drag may be treated in the collisionless\napproximation. As temperature is raised, the electron mean free path becomes\nshort due to electron-electron scattering. This leads to local equilibration of\nelectron liquid, and consequently drag is determined by hydrodynamic density\nmodes. Our theory applies to both the collisionless and the hydrodynamic\nregimes, and it enables us to describe the crossover between them. We find that\ndrag resistivity exhibits a nonmonotonic temperature dependence with multiple\ncrossovers at distinct energy scales. At the lowest temperatures, Coulomb drag\nis dominated by the particle-hole continuum, whereas at higher temperatures of\nthe collision-dominated regime it is governed by the plasmon modes. We observe\nthat fast intralayer equilibration mediated by electron-electron collisions\nultimately renders a stronger drag effect.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}

{"prompt": "  Cells generally convert nutrient resources to useful products via energy\ntransduction. Accordingly, the thermodynamic efficiency of this conversion\nprocess is one of the most essential characteristics of living organisms.\nHowever, although these processes occur under conditions of dynamic metabolism,\nmost studies of cellular thermodynamic efficiency have been restricted to\nexamining steady states; thus, the relevance of dynamics to this efficiency has\nnot yet been elucidated. Here, we develop a simple model of metabolic reactions\nwith anabolism-catabolism coupling catalysed by enzymes. Through application of\nexternal oscillation in the enzyme abundances, the thermodynamic efficiency of\nmetabolism was found to be improved. This result is in strong contrast with\nthat observed in the oscillatory input, in which the efficiency always\ndecreased with oscillation. This improvement was effectively achieved by\nseparating the anabolic and catabolic reactions, which tend to disequilibrate\neach other, and taking advantage of the temporal oscillations so that each of\nthe antagonistic reactions could progress near equilibrium. In this case,\nanti-phase oscillation between the reaction flux and chemical affinity through\noscillation of enzyme abundances is essential. This improvement was also\nconfirmed in a model capable of generating autonomous oscillations in enzyme\nabundances. Finally, the possible relevance of the improvement in thermodynamic\nefficiency is discussed with respect to the potential for manipulation of\nmetabolic oscillations in microorganisms.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}

An agent's payoff is higher if her action\nmatches the state or if more agents take the same action as hers.

Unlike previous\nmethods, SCARLET combines the physical and chemical consistency of complex\natmospheric models with the statistical treatment of observational\nuncertainties known from atmospheric retrieval techniques. I find that all\neight hot Jupiters consistently require carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O) below\n0.9. The finding of C/O<0.9 is highly robust for HD209458b, WASP-12b, WASP-19b,\nHAT-P-1b, and XO-1b. For HD189733b, WASP-17b, and WASP-43b, I find that the\npublished WFC3 transmission spectra favor C/O<0.9 at greater than 95%\nconfidence. I further show that the water abundances on all eight hot Jupiters\nare consistent with solar composition. The relatively small depth of the\ndetected water absorption features is due to the presence of clouds, not due to\na low water abundance as previously suggested for HD209458b.

The object is known to vary in light, color, and velocity\ndue to pulsation with a period of 132 days. The light and color variations are\naccompanied by significant changes in spectral features, most of which are\nidentified as lines of carbon-bearing molecules. According to the observations,\nthe $C_2$ Swan system and CN Red system lines are stronger near the light\nminimum. A photospheric spectrum of the central star was calculated using new\nself-consistent atmospheric models. The observed intensity variations in the\n$C_2$ Swan system and CN Red system lines were found to be much larger than\nexpected if due solely to the temperature variation in the atmosphere of the\npulsating star. In addition, the molecular lines are blueshifted relative to\nthe photospheric velocity. The site of formation of the strong molecular\nfeatures appears to be a cool outflow triggered by the pulsation. The\nvariability in atomic lines seems to be mostly due variations of the effective\ntemperature during the pulsation cycle. The profiles of strong atomic lines are\nsplit, and some of them are variable in a time scale of a week or so, probably\nbecause of shock waves in the outer atmosphere.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}
{"prompt": "  Protein function and dynamics are closely related to its sequence and\nstructure. However prediction of protein function and dynamics from its\nsequence and structure is still a fundamental challenge in molecular biology.\nProtein classification, which is typically done through measuring the\nsimilarity be- tween proteins based on protein sequence or physical\ninformation, serves as a crucial step toward the understanding of protein\nfunction and dynamics. Persistent homology is a new branch of algebraic\ntopology that has found its success in the topological data analysis in a\nvariety of disciplines, including molecular biology. The present work explores\nthe potential of using persistent homology as an indepen- dent tool for protein\nclassification. To this end, we propose a molecular topological fingerprint\nbased support vector machine (MTF-SVM) classifier. Specifically, we construct\nmachine learning feature vectors solely from protein topological fingerprints,\nwhich are topological invariants generated during the filtration process. To\nvalidate the present MTF-SVM approach, we consider four types of problems.\nFirst, we study protein-drug binding by using the M2 channel protein of\ninfluenza A virus. We achieve 96% accuracy in discriminating drug bound and\nunbound M2 channels. Additionally, we examine the use of MTF-SVM for the\nclassification of hemoglobin molecules in their relaxed and taut forms and\nobtain about 80% accuracy. The identification of all alpha, all beta, and\nalpha-beta protein domains is carried out in our next study using 900 proteins.\nWe have found a 85% success in this identifica- tion. Finally, we apply the\npresent technique to 55 classification tasks of protein superfamilies over 1357\nsamples. An average accuracy of 82% is attained. The present study establishes\ncomputational topology as an independent and effective alternative for protein\nclassification.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}

We further find\nthat, in the mean-field approximation, the BPS Skyrme model approaches the\nWalecka model in the limit of high density - their thermodynamical functions as\nwell as the equation of state agree in this limit. This fact allows to read off\nsome properties of the $\\omega$-meson from the BPS Skyrme action, even though\nthe latter model is entirely based on the (pionic) $SU(2)$ Skyrme field.

In order to evaluate realistic error\nbars within the theoretical uncertainties associated to the spherical\nmean-field approach, and the present information from already synthetized\nhypernuclei on the $N-Y$ and $Y-Y$ channels, we limit ourselves to purely\n$\\Lambda$-hypernuclei, to magic numbers of $\\Lambda$'s (for Z $\\leq$ 120 and\n$\\Lambda \\leq$70), and to even-even-even systems. We consider a density\nfunctional approach adjusted to microscopic Bruckner-Hartree-Fock calculations,\nwhere the $\\Lambda\\Lambda$ term is corrected in a phenomenological way, to\nreproduce present experimental constraints. The number of bound even-even-even\n$\\Lambda$-hypernuclei is estimated to 491680 $\\pm$ 34400. This relatively low\nuncertainty is due to the fact that the well constrained low density and highly\nunconstrained high density behavior of the energy functional turn out to be\nlargely decoupled. Results in $\\Lambda$-hypernuclei appear to be almost\nindependent of the choice for the high-density part of the $\\Lambda\\Lambda$\ninteraction. The location of the $\\Lambda$-hyperdriplines is also evaluated.\nSignificant deviations from Iron-Nickel elements can be found for\n$\\Lambda$-hypernuclei with the largest binding energy per baryon. Proton,\nneutron and $\\Lambda$-hyperon magicity evolution and triple magic\n$\\Lambda$-hypernuclei are studied. Possible bubbles and haloes effect in\n$\\Lambda$-hypernuclei are also discussed.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}
{"prompt": "  We introduce a novel method to obtain level densities in large-scale\nshell-model calculations. Our method is a stochastic estimation of eigenvalue\ncount based on a shifted Krylov-subspace method, which enables us to obtain\nlevel densities of huge Hamiltonian matrices. This framework leads to a\nsuccessful description of both low-lying spectroscopy and the experimentally\nobserved equilibration of $J^\\pi=2^+$ and $2^-$ states in $^{58}$Ni in a\nunified manner.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}
{"prompt": "  The recently developed pragmatical model of asymmetric double-well potentials\nwith a finite lifetime is applied to nonlinear dielectric data in polar\nundercooled liquids. The viscous effects from the finite lifetime provide a\ncrossover from the cooperative jumps of many molecules at short times to the\nmotion of statistically independent molecules at long times. The model allows\nto determine the size of cooperatively rearranging regions from nonlinear\n{\\omega}-data and throws a new light on a known inconsistency between nonlinear\n{\\omega} and 3{\\omega}-signals for glycerol and propylene carbonate.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}

{"prompt": "  Solar active region (AR) 12192 of October 2014 hosts the largest sunspot\ngroup in 24 years. It is the most prolific flaring site of Cycle 24, but\nsurprisingly produced no coronal mass ejection (CME) from the core region\nduring its disk passage. Here, we study the magnetic conditions that prevented\neruption and the consequences that ensued. We find AR 12192 to be \"big but\nmild\"; its core region exhibits weaker non-potentiality, stronger overlying\nfield, and smaller flare-related field changes compared to two other major\nflare-CME-productive ARs (11429 and 11158). These differences are present in\nthe intensive-type indices (e.g., means) but generally not the extensive ones\n(e.g., totals). AR 12192's large amount of magnetic free energy does not\ntranslate into CME productivity. The unexpected behavior suggests that AR\neruptiveness is limited by some relative measure of magnetic non-potentiality\nover the restriction of background field, and that confined flares may leave\nweaker photospheric and coronal imprints compared to their eruptive\ncounterparts.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}

{"prompt": "  The problem of estimating subjective visual properties from image and video\nhas attracted increasing interest. A subjective visual property is useful\neither on its own (e.g. image and video interestingness) or as an intermediate\nrepresentation for visual recognition (e.g. a relative attribute). Due to its\nambiguous nature, annotating the value of a subjective visual property for\nlearning a prediction model is challenging. To make the annotation more\nreliable, recent studies employ crowdsourcing tools to collect pairwise\ncomparison labels because human annotators are much better at ranking two\nimages/videos (e.g. which one is more interesting) than giving an absolute\nvalue to each of them separately. However, using crowdsourced data also\nintroduces outliers. Existing methods rely on majority voting to prune the\nannotation outliers/errors. They thus require large amount of pairwise labels\nto be collected. More importantly as a local outlier detection method, majority\nvoting is ineffective in identifying outliers that can cause global ranking\ninconsistencies. In this paper, we propose a more principled way to identify\nannotation outliers by formulating the subjective visual property prediction\ntask as a unified robust learning to rank problem, tackling both the outlier\ndetection and learning to rank jointly. Differing from existing methods, the\nproposed method integrates local pairwise comparison labels together to\nminimise a cost that corresponds to global inconsistency of ranking order. This\nnot only leads to better detection of annotation outliers but also enables\nlearning with extremely sparse annotations. Extensive experiments on various\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that our new approach significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-arts alternatives.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}
{"prompt": "  An incidence in a graph $G$ is a pair $(v,e)$ where $v$ is a vertex of $G$\nand $e$ is an edge of $G$ incident to $v$. Two incidences $(v,e)$ and $(u,f)$\nare adjacent if at least one of the following holds: $(a)$ $v = u$, $(b)$ $e =\nf$, or $(c)$ $vu \\in \\{e,f\\}$. An incidence coloring of $G$ is a coloring of\nits incidences assigning distinct colors to adjacent incidences. It was\nconjectured that at most $\\Delta(G) + 2$ colors are needed for an incidence\ncoloring of any graph $G$. The conjecture is false in general, but the bound\nholds for many classes of graphs. We introduce some sufficient properties of\nthe two factor graphs of a Cartesian product graph $G$ for which $G$ admits an\nincidence coloring with at most $\\Delta(G) + 2$ colors.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15\n"}

{"prompt": "  We consider a problem of linear model selection in the presence of both\ncontinuous and categorical predictors.

In the article we prove\nconsistency of DMR when the number of predictors tends to infinity with the\nsample size and describe a simulation study using a pertaining R package.
