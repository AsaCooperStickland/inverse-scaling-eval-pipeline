The main focus of the paper is the question: How large and\nstrong should a subgroup be in order to dominate the game? The concrete model\nstudied here is based on the popular game ``Mafia.'' In this game, there are\nthree groups of players: Mafia, detectives and ordinary citizens. Initially,\neach player is given only his/her own identity, except the mafia, who are given\nthe identities of all mafia members. At each ``open'' round, a vote is made to\ndetermine which player to eliminate. Additionally, there are collective\ndecisions made by the mafia where they decide to eliminate a citizen. Finally,\neach detective accumulates data on the mafia/citizen status of players. The\ncitizens win if they eliminate all mafia members. Otherwise, the mafia wins.

We construct a dg free wheeled PROP whose\nrepresentations are in one-to-one correspondence with formal germs of\nSP-manifolds, key geometric objects in the theory of Batalin-Vilkovisky\nquantization. We also construct minimal wheeled resolutions of classical\noperads Com and Ass as rather non-obvious extensions of Com_infty and\nAss_infty, involving, e.g., a mysterious mixture of associahedra with\ncyclohedra. Finally, we apply the above results to a computation of cohomology\nof a directed version of Kontsevich's complex of ribbon graphs.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20ma"}
{"prompt": "  Let E be an elliptic curve over Q (or, more generally, a number field). Then\non the one hand, we have the finitely generated abelian group E(Q), on the\nother hand, there is the Shafarevich-Tate group Sha(Q,E). Descent is a general\nmethod of getting information on both of these objects - ideally complete\ninformation on the Mordell-Weil group E(Q), and usually partial information on\nSha(Q,E).\n  What descent does is to compute (for a given n > 1) the n-Selmer group\nSel^(n)(Q,E); it sits in an exact sequence\n  0 --> E(Q)/nE(Q) --> Sel^(n)(Q,E) --> Sha(Q,E)[n] --> 0 and thus contains\ncombined information on E(Q) and Sha(Q,E). The main problem I want to discuss\nin this ``short course'' is how to actually do this explicitly, with some\nemphasis on obtaining representations of the elements of the Selmer group as\nexplicit covering spaces of E. These explicit representations are useful in two\nrespects - they allow a search for rational points (if successful, this proves\nthat the element is in the image of the left hand map above), and they provide\nthe starting point for performing ``higher'' descents (e.g., extending a\np-descent computation to a p^2-descent computation).\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20ma"}
{"prompt": "  Let E be an elliptic curve over Q, and rho_l: Gal(Q) --> GL_2(Z_l) its l-adic\nGalois representation. Serre observed that for l>3 there is no proper closed\nsubgroup of SL_2(Z_l) that maps surjectively onto SL_2(Z/lZ), and concluded\nthat if rho_l is surjective mod l then it is surjective onto GL_2(Z_l). We show\nthat this no longer holds for l=3 by describing a modular curve X of genus 0\nparametrizing elliptic curves for which rho_3 is not surjective mod 9 but\ngenerically surjective mod 3. The curve X is defined over Q, and the modular\ncover X --> X(1) has degree 27 so X is rational. We exhibit an explicit\nrational function of degree 27 that realizes this cover, and use it to exhibit\nseveral elliptic curves with nonzero j-invariant that satisfy this condition on\nrho_3, of which the simplest are the curves Y^2 = X^3 - 27X - 42 and Y^2 + Y =\nX^3 - 135X - 604 of conductors 1944 = 2^3 3^5 and 6075 = 3^5 5^2 respectively.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20ma"}

The proofs are achieved via nonstandard analysis.

{"prompt": "  It is shown that every bundle $\\varSigma\\to M$ of complex spinor modules over\nthe Clifford bundle $\\Cl(g)$ of a Riemannian space $(M,g)$ with local model\n$(V,h)$ is associated with an lpin (\"Lipschitz\") structure on $M$, this being a\nreduction of the ${\\Ort}(h)$-bundle of all orthonormal frames on M to the\nLipschitz group $\\Lpin(h)$ of all automorphisms of a suitably defined spin\nspace. An explicit construction is given of the total space of the\n$\\Lpin(h)$-bundle defining such a structure. If the dimension m of M is even,\nthen the Lipschitz group coincides with the complex Clifford group and the lpin\nstructure can be reduced to a pin$^{c}$ structure. If m=2n-1, then a spinor\nmodule $\\varSigma$ on M is of the Cartan type: its fibres are 2^n-dimensional\nand decomposable at every point of M, but the homomorphism of bundles of\nalgebras $\\Cl(g)\\to\\End\\varSigma$ globally decomposes if, and only if, M is\norientable. Examples of such bundles are given. The topological condition for\nthe existence of an lpin structure on an odd-dimensional Riemannian manifold is\nderived and illustrated by the example of a manifold admitting such a\nstructure, but no pin^c structure.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20ma"}
