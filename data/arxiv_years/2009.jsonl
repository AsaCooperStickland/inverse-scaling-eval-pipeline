Ultra-sensitive\ndetection of biological species with carbon nanotubes can be realized after\nsurface passivation to inhibit the non-specific binding of bio-molecules on the\nhydrophobic nanotube surface. Electrical nanosensors based on nanotubes provide\na label-free approach to biological detections. Surface enhanced Raman\nspectroscopy of CNT opens up a method of protein microarray with down to 1 fM\ndetection sensitivity. In vitro and in vivo toxicity studies reveal that well\nwater soluble and serum stable nanotubes are biocompatible, non-toxic and\npotentially useful for biomedical applications. In vivo biodistributions vary\nwith the functionalization and possibly also sizes of nanotubes, with a\ntendency of accumulation in the reticuloendothelial systems, including the\nliver and spleen, after intravenous administration. If well functionalized,\nnanotubes may be excreted mainly through the biliary pathway in feces.

A relationship between surface brightness and velocity dispersion can be\nexplained through simple energy injection arguments and a scaling set by nearby\ngalaxies with no free parameters. The high velocity dispersions are a natural\nconsequence of intense star formation thus regions of high velocity dispersion\nare not evidence for mass concentrations such as bulges or rings. External\nmechanisms like cosmological gas accretion generally do not have enough energy\nto sustain the high velocity dispersions.

Consequently, one may use\nlensing to check for this consistency and test GR. After reviewing the\nphenomenology of such tests, we address one major challenge to such a program.\nThe evolution of the baryonic component of the Universe is highly uncertain and\ncan influence lensing observables, manifesting as modified structure growth for\na fixed cosmic distance scale. Using two proposed methods, we show that one\ncould be led to reject the null hypothesis of GR when it is the true theory if\nthis uncertainty in baryonic processes is neglected.

Both the\nradio and X-ray light curve show evidence for flares. The radio - X-ray\ncorrelation can be well described by a power-law with index ~0.18. This is much\nlower than the index of 0.6-0.7 found for the decay of several black hole\ntransients before. The radio spectral index measured during one of the radio\nflares while the source is in the low-hard state, is -0.5+-0.15, which\nindicates that the radio emission is optically thin.
