{"prompt": "  The article presents new model of equilibrium in open chemical systems\nsuggesting a linear dependence of the reaction shift from equilibrium in\npresence of the external thermodynamic force. Basic equation of this model\ncontains traditional logarithmic term and a non-traditional parabolic term. At\nisolated equilibrium the non-traditional term equals to zero turning the whole\nequation to the traditional form of constant equation. This term coincides with\nthe excessive thermodynamic function revealing linear relationship between\nlogarithm of the thermodynamic activity coefficient and reaction extent at open\nequilibrium. Discovered relationship prompts us to use in many systems a\ncombination of the linearity coefficient and reaction shift from true\nequilibrium rather then activity coefficients. The coefficient of linearity can\nbe found by thermodynamic computer simulation while the shift is an independent\nvariable defining the open equilibrium state. Numerical data obtained by\nvarious simulation techniques proved premise of the method of chemical\ndynamics.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20ph"}

It is found that the light trajectories are similar\nto those around a black hole, in the sense that there exists a critical radius\nwithin which the light cannot escape, but spirals into the singularity.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20ph"}

These structures are responsible for the\nintermittency, and, in the same time, they contribute into asymmetry of\nturbulent statistics, the latter following from the Kolmogorov law.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20ph"}
{"prompt": "  An analytical model is presented for a rectangular lattice of isotropic\nscatterers with electric and magnetic resonances. Each isotropic scatterer is\nformed by putting appropriately 6 $\\Omega$-shaped perfectly conducting\nparticles on the faces of a cubic unit cell. A self-consistent dispersion\nequation is derived and then used to calculate correctly the effective\npermittivity and permeability in the frequency band where the lattice can be\nhomogenized. The frequency range in which both the effective permittivity and\npermeability are negative corresponds to the mini-band of backward waves within\nthe resonant band of the individual isotropic scatterer.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20ph"}
{"prompt": "  We report on the design and test results of a prototype processor for the CMS\nLevel-1 trigger that performs 3-D track reconstruction and measurement from\ndata recorded by the cathode strip chambers of the endcap muon system. The\ntracking algorithms are written in C++ using a class library we developed that\nfacilitates automatic conversion to Verilog. The code is synthesized into\nfirmware for field-programmable gate-arrays from the Xilinx Virtex-II series. A\nsecond-generation prototype has been developed and is currently under test. It\nperforms regional track-finding in a 60 degree azimuthal sector and accepts 3\nGB/s of input data synchronously with the 40 MHz beam crossing frequency. The\nlatency of the track-finding algorithms is expected to be 250 ns, including\ngeometrical alignment correction of incoming track segments and a final\nmomentum assignment based on the muon trajectory in the non-uniform magnetic\nfield in the CMS endcaps.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20ph"}
{"prompt": "  Semi-empirical procedure of obtaining the boundary conditions for strong\nevaporation of a polyatomic gas from a plane surface is proposed. The procedure\nis based on specifying the dependencies of specific momentum and enthalpy of\nthe flow from the gas flow rate. The latter are derived from the analysis of\nthe available data concerning the evaporation of polyatomic and monatomic\ngases. The procedure predicts the exactly sonic terminal velocity of the flow\nand leads to some corrections of existing boundary conditions in transonic\nregion. Thus, for j = 2 and sonic flow the corrections for pressure,\ntemperature and fraction of back-scattered molecules are about 0.7%, -3% and\n-8%.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20ph"}
{"prompt": "  We reconsider the problem of the stability of the thermohaline circulation as\ndescribed by a two-dimensional Boussinesq model with mixed boundary conditions.\nWe determine how the stability properties of the system depend on the intensity\nof the hydrological cycle. We define a two-dimensional parameters' space\ndescriptive of the hydrology of the system and determine, by considering\nsuitable quasi-static perturbations, a bounded region where multiple equilibria\nof the system are realized. We then focus on how the response of the system to\nfinite-amplitude surface freshwater forcings depends on their rate of increase.\nWe show that it is possible to define a robust separation between slow and fast\nregimes of forcing. Such separation is obtained by singling out an estimate of\nthe critical growth rate for the anomalous forcing, which can be related to the\ncharacteristic advective time scale of the system.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20ph"}
{"prompt": "  The rotations of microscopic magnetic particles, magnetosomes, embedded into\nthe cytoskeleton are considered. A great number of magnetosomes are shown to\npossess two stable equilibrium positions, between which there occur transitions\nunder the influence of thermal disturbances. The random rotations attain the\nvalue of order of radian. The rate of the transitions and the probability of\nmagnetosomes to stay in the different states depend on magnetic field direction\nwith respect to an averaged magnetosome's orientation. This effect explains the\nability of migrant birds to faultless orientation in long-term passages in the\nabsence of the direct visibility of optical reference points. The sensitivity\nto deviation from an `ideal' orientation is estimated to be 1-2 degrees.\nPossible participation of magnetosomes in biological effects caused by\nmicrowave electromagnetic fields is discussed.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20ph"}

{"prompt": "  The Rayleigh-Taylor instability plays an important role in the dynamics of\nseveral astronomical objects, in particular, in supernovae (SN) evolution. In\nthis paper we develop an analytical approach to study the stability analysis of\nspherical expansion of the SN ejecta by using a special transformation in the\nco-moving coordinate frame. We first study a non-stationary spherical expansion\nof a gas shell under the pressure of a central source. Then we analyze its\nstability with respect to a no radial, non spherically symmetric perturbation\nof the of the shell. We consider the case where the polytropic constant of the\nSN shell is $\\gamma=5/3$ and we examine the evolution of a arbitrary shell\nperturbation. The dispersion relation is derived. The growth rate of the\nperturbation is found and its temporal and spatial evolution is discussed. The\nstability domain depends on the ejecta shell thickness, its acceleration, and\nthe perturbation wavelength.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20ph"}
{"prompt": "  The Cellular Potts Model (CPM) has been used for simulating various\nbiological phenomena such as differential adhesion, fruiting body formation of\nthe slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, angiogenesis, cancer invasion,\nchondrogenesis in embryonic vertebrate limbs, and many others.

This equation is then\nreduced to the classical macroscopic Keller-Segel model.

{"prompt": "  The properties of a partially ionized plasma in a long cylindrical tube\nsubject to a uniform axial electric field are investigated. The plasma is\nmaintained by an external ionizing source balanced by bulk and surface\nrecombinations. Collisions between neutrals, whose density greatly exceeds the\ndensity of charged particles, and of neutrals with ions are sufficiently\neffective for their velocity distribution to be close to a Maxwellian with the\nsame uniform temperature, independent of the external field. The behavior of\nthe plasma is described by a collisional two-fluid scheme with charge\nneutrality in the interior of the tube. Approximate nonlinear equations for the\nhydrodynamical moments are obtained from a Boltzmann equation in which\nelectron-neutral, electron-ion and electron-electron collisions are all\nimportant. It is found that under certain circumstances the current, and the\ntemperature of the electrons undergo a drastic change, with hysteresis, as the\nelectric field is varied.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20ph"}
