{"prompt": "  Wavelength determines the length scale of the cross section when\nelectromagnetic waves are scattered by an electrically small object. The cross\nsection diverges for resonant scattering, and diminishes for non-resonant\nscattering, when wavelength approaches infinity.

We show\nthat such wavelength scaling comes from free space's conical dispersion at zero\nfrequency. Emerging Weyl systems, offering similar dispersion at non-zero\nfrequencies, lead to new laws of electromagnetic scattering that allow cross\nsections to be decoupled from the wavelength limit.

We have obtained a new ESPaDOnS magnetic\nmeasurement of HD 108, 6 years after the last reported measurement. The star is\nreturning to a spectroscopic high state, although its emission lines are still\nbelow their maximum observed strength, consistent with the proposed 55-year\nperiod. We measured $\\langle B_z\\rangle=-325 \\pm 45$ G, twice the strength of\nthe 2007-2009 observations, raising the lower limit of the dipole surface\nmagnetic field strength to $B_{\\rm d} \\ge 1$ kG. The simultaneous increase in\n$\\langle B_z\\rangle$~and emission strength is consistent with the oblique\nrotator model. Extrapolation of the $\\langle B_z\\rangle$~maximum via comparison\nof HD 108's spectroscopic and magnetic data with the similar Of?p star HD\n191612 suggests that $B_{\\rm d} > 2$~kG, yielding $t_{\\rm S, max}<3$~Myr,\ncompatible with the stellar age. These results also yield a better agreement\nbetween the observed X-ray luminosity and that predicted by the XADM model.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 10"}

During such events, the accretion rate\ncan evolve significantly between bursts, and this regime provides a unique test\nfor burst models.

This metastructural level\noffers a flexible framework through which information is continuously and\noperatively being symbolized.

Thus, in simple yield stress fluids\nshear banding was considered to be absent. Recent spatially resolved\nrheological experiments have found simple yield stress fluids to exhibit shear\nbanded flow profiles. One proposed mechanism for the initiation of such\ntransient shear banding process has been a small stress heterogeneity rising\nfrom the experimental device geometry. Here, using Computational Fluid Dynamics\nmethods, we show that transient shear banding can be initialized even under\nhomogeneous stress conditions by the fluid start-up inertia, and that such\nmechanism indeed is present in realistic experimental conditions.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 09"}

The major component is the inhibition of the convective\nblueshift due to plages. We explore a new approach to correct for this major\ncomponent of stellar radial velocities in the case of solar-type stars.

We build realistic RV time series corresponding to RVs\ncomputed using different sets of lines, including lines in different depth\nranges. We characterize the performance of the method used to reconstruct the\nsignal without the convective component and the detection limits derived from\nthe residuals. We identified a set of lines which, combined with a global set\nof lines, allows us to reconstruct the convective component with a good\nprecision and to correct for it. For the full temporal sampling, the power in\nthe range 100-500~d significantly decreased, by a factor of 100 for a RV noise\nbelow 30 cm/s.

We found that these other sources of noise do\nnot greatly alter the quality of the correction, although they need a better\nnoise level to reach a similar performance level.

{"prompt": "  Binary neutron star mergers are considered to be the most favorable sources\nthat produce electromagnetic (EM) signals associated with gravitational waves\n(GWs). These mergers are the likely progenitors of short duration gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs). The brief gamma-ray emission (the \"prompt GRB\" emission) is\nproduced by ultra-relativistic jets, as a result, this emission is strongly\nbeamed over a small solid angle along the jet. It is estimated to be a decade\nor more before a short GRB jet within the LIGO volume points along our line of\nsight. For this reason, the study of the prompt signal as an EM counterpart to\nGW events has been sparse. We argue that for a realistic jet model, one whose\nluminosity and Lorentz factor vary smoothly with angle, the prompt signal can\nbe detected for a significantly broader range of viewing angles. This can lead\nto a new type of EM counterpart, an \"off-axis\" short GRB. Our estimates and\nsimulations show that it is feasible to detect these signals with the aid of\nthe temporal coincidence from a LIGO trigger, even if the observer is\nsubstantially misaligned with respect to the jet.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 17"}
{"prompt": "  We combine the theoretical method of calculating spin wave excitation with\nthe finite-temperature modeling and calculate the magnon-phonon relaxation time\nin the technologically important material Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) from first\nprinciples. The finite lifetime of magnon excitation is found to arise from the\nfluctuation of the exchange interaction of magnetic atoms in YIG. At room\ntemperature, the magnon spectra have significant broadening that is used to\nextract the magnon-phonon relaxation time quantitatively. The latter is a\nphenomenological parameter of great importance in YIG-based spintronics\nresearch. We find that the magnon-phonon relaxation time for the optical magnon\nis a constant while that for the acoustic magnon is proportional to $1/k^2$ in\nthe long-wavelength regime.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15"}
