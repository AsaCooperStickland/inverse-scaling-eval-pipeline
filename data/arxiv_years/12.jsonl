{"prompt": "  With SDSS galaxy data and halo data from up-to-date N-body simulations we\nconstruct a semi-empirical catalog (SEC) of early-type systems by making a\nself-consistent bivariate statistical match of stellar mass (M_star) and\nvelocity dispersion (sigma) with halo virial mass (M_vir). We then assign\nstellar mass profile and velocity dispersion profile parameters to each system\nin the SEC using their observed correlations with M_star and sigma.\nSimultaneously, we solve for dark matter density profile of each halo using the\nspherical Jeans equation. The resulting dark matter density profiles deviate in\ngeneral from the dissipationless profile of NFW or Einasto and their mean inner\ndensity slope and concentration vary systematically with M_vir. Statistical\ntests of the distribution of profiles at fixed M_vir rule out the null\nhypothesis that it follows the distribution predicted by N-body simulations for\nM_vir ~< 10^{13.5-14.5} M_solar. These dark matter profiles imply that dark\nmatter density is, on average, enhanced significantly in the inner region of\nhalos with M_vir ~< 10^{13.5-14.5} M_solar supporting halo contraction. The\nmain characteristics of halo contraction are: (1) the mean dark matter density\nwithin the effective radius has increased by a factor varying systematically up\nto ~ 3-4 at M_vir = 10^{12} M_solar, and (2) the inner density slope has a mean\nof <alpha> ~ 1.3 with rho(r) ~ r^{-alpha} and a halo-to-halo rms scatter of\nrms(alpha) ~ 0.4-0.5 for 10^{12} M_solar ~< M_vir ~< 10^{13-14} M_solar steeper\nthan the NFW profile (alpha=1).

The gas in\nthese galaxies is not in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium. Supernova feedback,\nstellar winds, or active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can significantly\nperturb the interstellar medium (ISM). Using hydrodynamical simulations, we\ninvestigate the effect of subsonic turbulence in the hot ISM on the ram\npressure stripping process in early-type galaxies. We find that galaxies with\nmore turbulent ISM produce longer, wider, and more smoothly distributed tails\nof the stripped ISM than those characterised by weaker ISM turbulence. Our main\nconclusion is that even very weak internal turbulence, at the level of <15% of\nthe average ISM sound speed, can significantly accelerate the gas removal from\ngalaxies via ram pressure stripping. The magnitude of this effect increases\nsharply with the strength of turbulence. As most of the gas stripping takes\nplace near the boundary between the ISM and the intraclustermedium (ICM), the\nboost in the ISM stripping rate is due to the \"random walk\" of the ISM from the\ncentral regions of the galactic potential well to larger distances, where the\nram pressure is able to permanently remove the gas from galaxies. The ICM can\nbe temporarily trapped inside the galactic potential well due to the mixing of\nthe turbulent ISM with the ICM.

{"prompt": "  Bell inequalities, understood as constraints between classical conditional\nprobabilities, can be derived from a set of assumptions representing a common\ncausal explanation of classical correlations. A similar derivation, however, is\nnot known for Bell inequalities in algebraic quantum field theories\nestablishing constraints for the expectation of specific linear combinations of\nprojections in a quantum state. In the paper we address the question as to\nwhether a 'common causal justification' of these non-classical Bell\ninequalities is possible. We will show that although the classical notion of\ncommon causal explanation can readily be generalized for the non-classical\ncase, the Bell inequalities used in quantum theories cannot be derived from\nthese non-classical common causes. Just the opposite is true: for a set of\ncorrelations there can be given a non-classical common causal explanation even\nif they violate the Bell inequalities. This shows that the range of common\ncausal explanations in the non-classical case is wider than that restricted by\nthe Bell inequalities.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 12\n"}

The imaging data were corrected for intensity gradients, projection\neffects, and instrumental stray light prior to the analysis. The observations\nshow the formation of a light bridge at one corner of the sunspot by a slow\nintrusion of neighbouring penumbral filaments. This divided the umbra into two\nindividual umbral cores. During the light bridge formation, there was a steep\nincrease in its intensity from 0.28 to 0.7 I_QS in nearly 4 hr, followed by a\ngradual increase to quiet Sun (QS) values in 13 hr. This increase in intensity\nwas accompanied by a large reduction in the field strength from 1800 G to 300\nG. The smaller umbral core gradually broke away from the parent sunspot nearly\n2 days after the formation of the light bridge rendering the parent spot\nwithout a penumbra at the location of fragmentation. The penumbra in the\nfragment disappeared first within 34 hr, followed by the fragment whose area\ndecayed exponentially with a time constant of 22 hr. The depleted penumbra in\nthe parent sunspot regenerated when the inclination of the magnetic field at\nthe penumbra-QS boundary became within 40 deg. from being completely horizontal\nand this occurred near the end of the fragment's lifetime. After the\ndisappearance of the fragment, another light bridge formed in the parent which\nhad similar properties as the fragmenting one, but did not divide the sunspot.\nThe significant weakening in field strength in the light bridge along with the\npresence of granulation is suggestive of strong convection in the sunspot which\nmight have triggered the expulsion and fragmentation of the smaller spot.\nAlthough the presence of QS photospheric conditions in sunspot umbrae could be\na necessary condition for fragmentation, it is not a sufficient one.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 12\n"}

Here it is shown that, by\nadopting the doubled Lagrangian formalism, F-duality, defined on the doubled\nfield strengths, is not only a symmetry of the black hole solutions, but also\nof the equations of motion themselves. A further role for F-duality is\nintroduced in the context of world-sheet actions. The Nambu-Goto world-sheet\naction in any (t, s) signature spacetime can be written in terms of the F-dual.\nThe corresponding field equations and Bianchi identities are then related by\nF-duality allowing for an F-dual formulation of Gaillard-Zumino duality on the\nworld-sheet. An equivalent polynomial \"Polyakov- type\" action is introduced\nusing the so-called black hole potential. Such a construction allows for\nactions invariant under all groups of type E7, including E7 itself, although in\nthis case the stringy interpretation is less clear.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 12\n"}

At such locations, the Lindblad torque is known\nto suffer strong deviation from its standard value, with potentially important\nimplications for type I migration, but the full treatment of the tidal\ninteraction is cumbersome and not well suited to models of planetary population\nsynthesis. The expression that we propose retains the simplicity of the\nstandard Lindblad torque formula and gives results that accurately reproduce\nthose of numerical simulations, even at locations where the disk temperature\nundergoes abrupt changes. Our study is conducted by means of customized\nnumerical simulations in the low-mass regime, in locally isothermal disks, and\ncompared to linear torque estimates obtained by summing fully analytic torque\nestimates at each Lindblad resonance. The functional dependence of our modified\nLindblad torque expression is suggested by an estimate of the shift of the\nLindblad resonances that mostly contribute to the torque, in a disk with sharp\ngradients of temperature or surface density, while the numerical coefficients\nof the new terms are adjusted to seek agreement with numerics.

{"prompt": "  Enhancement of the trapping and optimization of the beam quality are two key\nissues of Laser Wake Field Acceleration (LWFA). The influence of stochastic\nacceleration on the trapping of electrons is compared to the one of cold\ninjection.

The effect of a homogenous constant\nmagnetic field $B_0$, parallel to the direction of propagation of the pump\npulse, is studied in the blowout regime. Transverse currents are generated at\nthe rim of the bubble, which results in the amplification of the $B_0$ field at\nthe rear of the bubble. Without $B_0$ field the beam periodically explodes and\nre-confines, this phenomenon is suppressed when $B_0$ reaches some threshold,\nwhich is a function of the laser pulses parameters (intensity, waist,\nduration). Therefore the dynamics of the beam is modified, its maximum energy\nis slightly boosted and above all transverse emittance reduced. Moreover the\nlow energy tail, observed in the non magnetized case, can be completely\nsuppressed leading to very sharp mono-energetic beam when $B_0$ is applied.

Despite Leo\nI's large Galacto-centric space velocity (200 km/s) and distance (261 kpc), we\nshow that it is extremely unlikely to be unbound if Galactic satellites are\nassociated with dark matter substructure, as 99.9% of subhalos in the\nsimulations are bound to their host. The observed position and velocity of Leo\nI strongly disfavor a low mass Milky Way: if we assume that Leo I is the least\nbound of the Milky Way's classical satellites, then we find that M_MW > 10^{12}\nM_sun at 95% confidence for a variety of Bayesian priors on M_MW. In lower mass\nhalos, it is vanishingly rare to find subhalos at 261 kpc moving as fast as Leo\nI.

Bright narrow\nemission features are observed, for the first time, in (mostly) ortho-ammonia\ntransitions, at V ~ 45 km/s, well separated from the quasi-thermal emission\nnear 60 km/s. These features were absent 25 years ago and show a velocity drift\nof about +0.2 km/s/yr.

{"prompt": "  Many short GRBs show prompt tails lasting up to hundreds of seconds that can\nbe energetically dominant over the initial sub-second spike. In this paper we\ndevelop an electromagnetic model of short GRBs that explains the two stages of\nthe energy release, the prompt spike and the prompt tail. The key ingredient of\nthe model is the recent discovery that an isolated black hole can keep its open\nmagnetic flux for times much longer than the collapse time and, thus, can\nspin-down electromagnetically, driving the relativistic wind.\n  First, the merger is preceded by an electromagnetic precursor wind. If a\nfraction of the wind power is converted into pulsar-like coherent radio\nemission, this may produce an observable radio burst of few milliseconds.\n  At the active stage of the merger, two neutron stars produces a black hole\nsurrounded by an accretion torus in which the amplified magnetic field extracts\nthe rotational energy of the black hole and drives an axially-collimated\nelectromagnetic wind. For observers nearly aligned with the orbital normal this\nis seen as a classical short GRB.\n  After the accretion of the torus, the isolated black hole keeps the open\nmagnetic flux and drives the equatorially (not axially) collimated outflow,\nwhich is seen by an observer at intermediate polar angles as a prompt tail. The\ntail carries more energy than the prompt spike, but its emission is de-boosted\nfor observers along the orbital normal. Observers in the equatorial plane miss\nthe prompt spike and interpret the prompt tail as an energetic supernova-less\nlong GRB.\n  We also demonstrate that episodic accretion onto the BH of magnetized clouds\nthat carry non-zero magnetic flux can be highly efficient in extracting the\nspin energy of the BH, producing the outflows with the power exceeding the\naverage accretion power.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 12\n"}

The stars are separated by\napproximately 16 pc and surrounded by a cold medium with a density of 20\nparticles per cubic cm. We use the MPI-AMRVAC hydrodynamics code to solve the\nconservation equations of hydrodynamics on a 2D cylindrical grid using\ntime-dependent models for the wind parameters of the two stars. At the end of\nthe stellar evolution (4.5 and 7.0 million years for the 40 and 25 solar mass\nstars, respectively), we simulate the supernova explosion of each star.

The combined bubble evolves over\ntime, influenced by the stellar winds and supernova explosions. The evolution\nof a wind-blown bubble created by two stars deviates from that of the bubbles\naround single stars. In particular, once one of the stars has exploded, the\nbubble is too large for the wind of the remaining star to maintain and the\nouter shell starts to disintegrate.

In graphene, however, it has been shown that inhomogeneous strains can\ninduce 'pseudomagnetic fields' that behave very similarly to real fields. Here,\nwe show experimentally and theoretically that, by properly structuring a\ndielectric lattice, it is possible to induce a pseudomagnetic field at optical\nfrequencies in a photonic lattice, where the propagation dynamics is equivalent\nto the evolution of an electronic wavepacket in graphene. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first realization of a pseudomagnetic field in optics. The induced\nfield gives rise to multiple photonic Landau levels (singularities in the\ndensity of states) separated by band gaps. We show experimentally and\nnumerically that the gaps between these Landau levels give rise to transverse\nconfinement of the optical modes. The use of strain allows for the exploration\nof magnetic effects in a non-resonant way that would be otherwise inaccessible\nin optics. Employing inhomogeneous strain to induce pseudomagnetism suggests\nthe possibility that aperiodic photonic crystal structures can achieve greater\nfield-enhancement and slow-light effects than periodic structures via the high\ndensity-of-states at Landau levels.

We propose a\ntest in CH based on the comparison between the rotational transitions between\nthe e and f components of the Omega'=1/2,J=1/2 and Omega'=3/2,J=3/2 levels at\n532 and 536 GHz and other rotational or Lambda-doublet transitions in CH\ninvolving the same absorbing ground levels.

{"prompt": "  Classical nova events in symbiotic stars, although rare, offer a unique\nopportunity to probe the interaction between ejecta and a dense environment in\nstellar explosions. In this work, we use X-ray data obtained with Swift and\nSuzaku during the recent classical nova outburst in V407 Cyg to explore such an\ninteraction. We find evidence of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium\nionization plasmas at the time of peak X-ray brightness, indicating a strong\nasymmetry in the density of the emitting region. Comparing a simple model to\nthe data, we find that the X-ray evolution is broadly consistent with nova\nejecta driving a forward shock into the dense wind of the Mira companion. We\ndetect a highly absorbed soft X-ray component in the spectrum during the first\n50 days of the outburst that is consistent with supersoft emission from the\nnuclear burning white dwarf. The high temperature and short turn off time of\nthis emission component, in addition to the observed breaks in the optical and\nUV lightcurves, indicate that the white dwarf in the binary is extremely\nmassive. Finally, we explore the connections between the X-ray and GeV\ngamma-ray evolution, and propose that the gamma ray turn-off is due to the\nstalling of the forward shock as the ejecta reach the red giant surface.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 12\n"}

To tackle such kind of problems, we develop a general\nsolution scheme based on a new energy dissection idea.

By distributing the kinetic energy term in part\ninto each individual potential, the Hamiltonian can be expressed as the sum of\nthe subsystem Hamiltonians with respective competing potentials. The total\nwavefunction is expanded by using a linear combination of the basis sets of\nrespective subsystem Hamiltonians.

Hence, the curve evolution of edge-based active contours can terminate\nearly before converging to the object boundaries with a careless contour\ninitialization. We propose a novel Geodesic Snakes (GeoSnakes) active contour\nthat requires the full gradients of the edge indicator to vanish at the optimal\nsolution.

The\nevolution of the nucleus energy with deformation is determined by the\nmacroscopic properties of the nucleus, and is also strongly influenced by the\nsingle-particle structure of the nucleus. The fission fragment distribution is\na direct consequence of the deformation path the nucleus has encountered, and\ntherefore is the most genuine experimental observation of the potential energy\nlandscape of the deforming nucleus. Very asymmetric fusion-fission reactions at\nenergy close to the Coulomb barrier, produce well-defined conditions of the\ncompound nucleus formation, where processes such as quasi-fission,\npre-equilibrium emission and incomplete fusion are negligible. In the same\ntime, the excitation energy is sufficient to reduce significantly structural\neffects, and mostly the macroscopic part of the potential is responsible for\nthe formation of the fission fragments. We use inverse kinematics combined with\nspectrometers to select and identify the fission fragments produced in\n$^{238}$U+$^{12}$C at a bombarding energy close to and well-above the Coulomb\nbarrier.

For the reconstruction\nprocedure based on quasielastic (QE) kinematics, all other reaction channels\nbeside true-QE scattering show a shift of the reconstructed energy towards\nlower values as compared to the true energy. On average in the MiniBooNE and\nT2K experiments the shift is 100 - 200 MeV and depends on energy. The\noscillation signals are similarly affected.

{"prompt": "  Background: The recent disagreement between the proton charge radius\nextracted from Lamb shift measurements of muonic and electronic hydrogen\ninvites speculation that new physics may be to blame. Several proposals have\nbeen made for new particles that account for both the Lamb shift and the muon\nanomalous moment discrepancies. Purpose: We explore the possibility that new\nparticles' couplings to the muon can be fine-tuned to account for all\nexperimental constraints. Method: We consider two fine-tuned models, the first\ninvolving new particles with scalar and pseudoscalar couplings, and the second\ninvolving new particles with vector and axial couplings. The couplings are\nconstrained by the Lamb shift and muon magnetic moments measurements while mass\nconstraints are obtained by kaon decay rate data. Results: For the\nscalar-pseudoscalar model, masses between 100 to 200 MeV are not allowed. For\nthe vector model, masses below about 200 MeV are not allowed. The strength of\nthe couplings for both models approach that of electrodynamics for particle\nmasses of about 2 GeV. Conclusions: New physics with fine tuned couplings may\nbe entertained as a possible explanation for the Lamb shift discrepancy.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 12\n"}

Using the cluster age\nand the mass of the white dwarf we constrain the mass of the white dwarf\nprogenitor star to lie in the range 3.5 - 3.7 Msun (B9).

Hence,\nthe initial separation of the system was ~2 AU, with common envelope evolution\nreducing the separation to its current value.

Specifically, we consider a polymer (single strand or star)\nattached to the tip of a cone, at a separation h from a surface (or another\ncone). At close proximity, such that h<<R_0, separation is the only remaining\nrelevant scale and the entropic force must take the form F=AkT/h. The amplitude\nA is universal, and can be related to exponents \\eta governing the anomalous\nscaling of polymer correlations in the presence of obstacles. We use\nanalytical, numerical and epsilon-expansion techniques to compute the exponent\n\\eta for a polymer attached to the tip of the cone (with or without an\nadditional plate or cone) for ideal and self-avoiding polymers. The entropic\nforce is of the order of 0.1 pN at 0.1 micron for a single polymer, and can be\nincreased for a star polymer.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 12\n"}

{"prompt": "  The origin of super-luminous supernovae (SLSNe), especially the source of\ntheir huge luminosities, has not been clarified yet. While a strong interaction\nbetween SN ejecta and dense circumstellar media (CSM) is a leading scenario,\nalternative models have been proposed. In this Letter, we suggest new\ndiagnostics to discriminate the strong SN-CSM interaction scenario from the\nothers: a decline in the luminosity ('dip') before the main peak of the light\ncurve. This dip is an unavoidable consequence of having a dense CSM within\nwhich the shock breakout occurs. If a dense CSM shell is located far at large\nradii from the progenitor inside, it takes time for the SN ejecta to reach it\nand the early light curve can be powered by the SN ejecta before the collision.\nOnce the SN ejecta collides with the dense CSM, the electron density and thus\nthe Thomson scattering opacity suddenly increase. Photons become unable to go\nout of the shock even if there is a source of emission inside, which results in\nthe dip in the light curve. This dip is a solid prediction from the strong\ninteraction scenario irrespective of a power source for the early emission.\nEventually the forward shock breaks out from within the dense CSM, and the\nluminosity increases by the continuous strong SN-CSM interaction, resulting in\nan SLSN. The possible dip observed in the hydrogen-poor SLSN, 2006oz, could be\nthe first example of this signature and give support to the SN-CSM interaction\nas the power source of SLSN 2006oz.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 12\n"}

Thus, we discuss how the tidal dissipation in\nsolid parts depends on the planet's internal structure and rheology. Finally,\nwe show how the results may be implemented to describe the dynamical evolution\nof planetary systems. The first manifestation of the tide is to distort the\nshape of the planet adiabatically along the line of centers. Then, the response\npotential of the body to the tidal potential defines the complex Love numbers\nwhose real part corresponds to the purely adiabatic elastic deformation, while\nits imaginary part accounts for dissipation. This dissipation is responsible\nfor the imaginary part of the disturbing function, which is implemented in the\ndynamical evolution equations, from which we derive the characteristic\nevolution times.

Upon formation, the disk orientation is generally\nmisaligned with the angular momentum of its host cloud core and it dynamically\nvaries during the main accretion phase, even though the turbulence is weak.\nThis is because the angular momentum of the entire cloud core is mainly\ndetermined by the large scale velocity field whose wavelength is comparable to\nthe cloud scale, whereas the angular momentum of the disk is determined by the\nlocal velocity field where the protostar forms and these two velocity fields do\nnot correlate with each other.

Interstellar dust\nextinction is measured from stacked spectra that cover the Balmer decrement\n(Halpha/Hbeta). We present dust extinction as a function of Halpha luminosity\n(down to 3 x 10^{41} erg/s), galaxy stellar mass (reaching 4 x 10^{8} Msun),\nand rest-frame Halpha equivalent width. The faintest galaxies are two times\nfainter in Halpha luminosity than galaxies previously studied at z~1.5. An\nevolution is observed where galaxies of the same Halpha luminosity have lower\nextinction at higher redshifts, whereas no evolution is found within our error\nbars with stellar mass. The lower Halpha luminosity galaxies in our sample are\nfound to be consistent with no dust extinction. We find an anti-correlation of\nthe [OIII]5007/Halpha flux ratio as a function of luminosity where galaxies\nwith L_{Halpha}<5 x 10^{41} erg/s are brighter in [OIII]5007 than Halpha.

If it is\nset within its classical mechanics roots, it is clear that it is a restricted\nform of a Lagrangian.\n  In advanced texts on fracture cracks are treated as dynamic entities, and the\nrole of stress waves is clearly articulated. However, in most non-advanced\ntexts on fracture and fatigue the role of stress waves are either not included\nor not emphasised, often leading to a possible misunderstanding of the\nfundamentals of fracture.\n  What is done here is to extend Griffiths approach by setting it within the\nconcept of Stationary Action, and introducing a quasi-static stress wave\nunloading model, which connects the energy release mechanism with the stress\nfield. This leads to a definition of a dynamic stress intensity factor, and\nthis model is then applied to fatigue of perfectly elastic and elastic-plastic\nmaterials to include crack tip plasticity.\n  The results for the Griffiths crack and the dynamic case are retrodiction, to\nestablish the validity of the methods used. The extension to fatigue gives\nsignificant new results, which show that for elastic-plastic materials the\ninfluence of the maximum stress in the cycle as a fraction of the yield stress,\ncalled the yield stress ratio, has not been recognised.

Here we present further results from an ongoing BAL monitoring\ncampaign of a sample of 24 luminous quasars at redshifts 1.2 < z < 2.9. We\ndirectly compare the variabilities in the CIV 1549 and SiIV 1400 absorption to\ntry to ascertain the cause(s) of the variability. We find that SiIV BALs are\nmore likely to vary than CIV BALs. When looking at flow speeds >-20 000 km/s,\n47 per cent of quasars exhibited SiIV variability while 31 per cent exhibited\nCIV variability. Furthermore, ~50 per cent of the variable SiIV regions did not\nhave corresponding CIV variability at the same velocities. When both CIV and\nSiIV varied, those changes always occurred in the same sense (either getting\nweaker or stronger). We also include our full data set so far in this paper,\nwhich includes up to 10 epochs of data per quasar. The multi-epoch data show\nthat the BAL changes were not generally monotonic across the full ~5 to ~8 yr\ntime span of our observations, suggesting that the characteristic time-scale\nfor significant line variations, and (perhaps) for structural changes in the\noutflows, is less than a few years. Coordinated variabilities between\nabsorption regions at different velocities in individual quasars seems to favor\nchanging ionization of the outflowing gas as the cause of the observed BAL\nvariability. However, variability in limited portions of broad troughs fits\nnaturally in a scenario where movements of individual clouds, or substructures\nin the flow, across our lines-of-sight cause the absorption to vary. The actual\nsituation may be a complex mixture of changing ionization and cloud movements.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 12\n"}

However, when this\nblack hole is embedded in string theory, it proves to be unstable, for all\nnon-zero angular momenta, to a certain non-perturbative effect: the familiar\nplanar black hole, as used in most AdS/CFT analyses of QGP physics, is\n\"fragile\". The upshot is that the AdS/CFT duality apparently predicts that the\nQGP should always become unstable when it is produced in peripheral collisions.\nHowever, we argue that holography indicates that relatively low angular momenta\ndelay the development of the instability, so that in practice it may be\nobservable only for peripheral collisions involving favourable impact\nparameters, generating extremely large angular momenta. The result may be\nholographic prediction of a cutoff for the observable angular momenta of the\nQGP, or perhaps of an analogous phenomenon in condensed matter physics.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 12\n"}

{"prompt": "  Blazars are strongly variable sources that occasionally show spectacular\nflares visible in various energy bands. These flares are often, but not always,\ncorrelated. In a number of cases the peaks of optical flares are found to be\nsomewhat delayed with respect to the gamma-ray peaks. One notable example of\nsuch a delay was found in 3C 279 by Hayashida et al. and interpreted as a\nresult of steeper drop with distance of the energy density of external\nradiation field than of the magnetic energy density. In this paper we\ndemonstrate that in general, depending on the respective energy density profile\nalong the jet, such lags can have both signs and that they can take place for\nany ratio of these energy densities. We study the dependence of such lags on\nthe ratio of these energy densities at a distance of a maximal energy\ndissipation in a jet, on their gradients, as well as on the time profile of the\nrelativistic electron injection within the moving source. We show how prominent\nsuch lags can be, and what are their expected time scales. We suggest that\nstudies of such lags can provide a powerful tool to resolve the structure of\nrelativistic jets and their radiative environment.

We\nprove in particular that choosing this type of mixed smoothness leads to rates\nof convergence which are free of the \"curse of dimensionality\" and, hence, are\nhigher than usual convergence rates when $r$ is large. The problem studied in\nthe paper is motivated by seismic inversion which can be reduced to solution of\nnoisy two-dimensional convolution equations that allow to draw inference on\nunderground layer structures along the chosen profiles. The common practice in\nseismology is to recover layer structures separately for each profile and then\nto combine the derived estimates into a two-dimensional function. By studying\nthe two-dimensional version of the model, we demonstrate that this strategy\nusually leads to estimators which are less accurate than the ones obtained as\ntwo-dimensional functional deconvolutions. Indeed, we show that unless the\nfunction $f$ is very smooth in the direction of the profiles, very spatially\ninhomogeneous along the other direction and the number of profiles is very\nlimited, the functional deconvolution solution has a much better precision\ncompared to a combination of $M$ solutions of separate convolution equations.

The objective of a search mechanism is to successfully locate\nresources while incurring low overhead and low delay.

Using a procedure based on our\nanalysis of finite-size effects in a related classical model (LC line) we show\nthat stationary currents can be obtained from transient currents in finite\nsystems driven out of equilibrium. The non-equilibrium dynamics of correlated\nquantum systems is calculated using the time-evolving block decimation method.\nTo demonstrate our method we determine the full I-V characteristic of the\nspinless fermion model with nearest-neighbour hopping t_H and interaction V_H\nusing two different setups to generate currents (turning on/off a potential\nbias). Our numerical results agree with exact results for non-interacting\nfermions (V_H=0). For interacting fermions we find that in the linear regime eV\n<< 4t_H the current I is independent from the setup and our numerical data\nagree with the predictions of the Luttinger liquid theory combined with the\nBethe Ansatz solution. For larger potentials V the steady-state current depends\non the current-generating setup and as V increases we find a negative\ndifferential conductance with one setup while the currents saturate at finite\nvalues in the other one.

In this work we give a full\npedagogical treatment of a special simple case of these models, which we call\nthe 3D semion model: We calculate its ground state degeneracies for a variety\nof boundary conditions, and classify its low-lying excitations. While point\ndefects in the bulk are confined in pairs connected by energetic strings, the\nsurface excitations are more interesting: the model has deconfined point\ndefects pinned to the boundary of the lattice, and these exhibit semionic\nbraiding statistics. The surface physics is reminiscent of a $\\nu=1/2$ bosonic\nfractional quantum Hall effect in its topological limit, and these\nconsiderations help motivate an effective field theoretic description for the\nlattice models as variants of $bF$ theories. Our special example of the 3D\nsemion model captures much of the behavior of more general `confined\nWalker-Wang models'. We contrast the 3D semion model with the closely related\n3D version of the toric code (a lattice gauge theory) which has deconfined\npoint excitations in the bulk and we discuss how more general models may have\nsome confined and some deconfined excitations. Having seen that there exist\nlattice models whose surfaces have the same topological order as a bosonic\nfractional quantum Hall effect on a confining bulk, we construct a lattice\nmodel whose surface has similar topological order to a fermionic quantum hall\neffect.

The goal of this paper is thus to compare the\nembedding approach to multi-parametric programming, mixed-integer programming\n(e.g., CPLEX), and gradient-descent based methods in the context of five\nrecently published examples: a spring-mass system, moving-target tracking for a\nmobile robot, two-tank filling, DC-DC boost converter, and skid-steered\nvehicle.

In addition, the\nembedding method requires no ad hoc assumptions (e.g., predetermined mode\nsequences) or specialized control models.

The openness condition shows also that ranking functions\nwith a discontinuous inference are typical. Moreover it shows that the\ninference is continuous in the restriction to any polytope which implies that a\ndiscontinuity belongs to the quantum domain of non-commutative observables and\nthat a geodesic closure of a Gibbsian family equals the set of maximum-entropy\nstates. We discuss eight descriptions of the set of maximum-entropy states with\nproofs of accuracy and an analysis of deviations.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 12\n"}

On the other hand, Ulysses data also suggest that the solar wind may\nrotate in two opposite ways between the northern and southern hemispheres. We\nshow that this result is not as surprising as it may seem and that it emerges\nnaturally from the ideal MHD equations. Specifically, counterrotating jets\nneither contradict the magnetocentrifugal driving of the flow nor prevent\nextraction of angular momentum from the disk. The demonstration of this result\nis shown by combining the ideal MHD equations for steady axisymmetric flows.\nProvided that the jet is decelerated below some given threshold beyond the\nAlfven surface, the flow will change its direction of rotation locally or\nglobally. Counterrotation is also possible for only some layers of the outflow\nat specific altitudes along the jet axis. We conclude that the counterrotation\nof winds or jets with respect to the source, star or disk, is not in\ncontradiction with the magnetocentrifugal driving paradigm. This phenomenon may\naffect part of the outflow, either in one hemisphere, or only in some of the\noutflow layers.

We\nhere consider a setup in which instances of the random constraints (the\nscenario) are not held by a single centralized processing unit, but are\ndistributed among different nodes of a network. Each node \"sees\" only a small\nsubset of the constraints, and may communicate with neighbors. The objective is\nto make all nodes converge to the same solution as the centralized RCP problem.\nTo this end, we develop two distributed algorithms that are variants of the\nconstraints consensus algorithm [4],[5]: the active constraints consensus (ACC)\nalgorithm, and the vertex constraints consensus (VCC) algorithm. We show that\nthe ACC algorithm computes the overall optimal solution in finite time, and\nwith almost surely bounded communication at each iteration.

However, we\nalso explore the possibility that the net Higgs to gluon-gluon and gamma-gamma\ncouplings have extra loop contributions coming from Beyond-the-Standard Model\nphysics. We find that the SM p-value ~ 0.5 is more than 2 sigma away from fits\nin which: a) there is some non-SM contribution to the gamma-gamma coupling of\nthe Higgs; or b) the sign of the top quark coupling to the Higgs is opposite\nthat of the W coupling. In both these cases p-values ~ 0.9 can be achieved.\nSince option b) is difficult to realize in realistic models, it would seem that\nnew physics contributions to the effective couplings of the Higgs are\npreferred.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 12\n"}
{"prompt": "  Debye shielding, collisional transport, Landau damping of Langmuir waves, and\nspontaneous emission of these waves are introduced, in typical plasma physics\ntextbooks, in different chapters. This paper provides a compact unified\nintroduction to these phenomena without appealing to fluid or kinetic models,\nbut by using Newton's second law for a system of $N$ electrons in a periodic\nbox with a neutralizing ionic background. A rigorous equation is derived for\nthe electrostatic potential. Its linearization and a first smoothing reveal\nthis potential to be the sum of the shielded Coulomb potentials of the\nindividual particles. Smoothing this sum yields the classical Vlasovian\nexpression including initial conditions in Landau contour calculations of\nLangmuir wave growth or damping. The theory is extended to accommodate a\ncorrect description of trapping or chaos due to Langmuir waves. In the linear\nregime, the amplitude of such a wave is found to be ruled by Landau growth or\ndamping and by spontaneous emission. Using the shielded potential, the\ncollisional diffusion coefficient is computed for the first time by a\nconvergent expression including the correct calculation of deflections for all\nimpact parameters. Shielding and collisional transport are found to be two\nrelated aspects of the repulsive deflections of electrons.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 12\n"}

Various pattern-formation scenarios\nare found above the threshold. Most typically, the soliton, hopping between\npotential cells, leaves arrayed patterns of different sizes in its wake. In the\nlaser cavity, this effect may be used as a mechanism for selective pattern\nformation controlled by the tilt of the seed beam.

{"prompt": "  Functional dependencies (FDs) specify the intended data semantics while\nviolations of FDs indicate deviation from these semantics. In this paper, we\nstudy a data cleaning problem in which the FDs may not be completely correct,\ne.g., due to data evolution or incomplete knowledge of the data semantics. We\nargue that the notion of relative trust is a crucial aspect of this problem: if\nthe FDs are outdated, we should modify them to fit the data, but if we suspect\nthat there are problems with the data, we should modify the data to fit the\nFDs. In practice, it is usually unclear how much to trust the data versus the\nFDs. To address this problem, we propose an algorithm for generating\nnon-redundant solutions (i.e., simultaneous modifications of the data and the\nFDs) corresponding to various levels of relative trust.

{"prompt": "  Observations of molecular clouds in metal-poor environments typically find\nthat they have much higher star formation rates than one would expect based on\ntheir observed CO luminosities and the molecular gas masses that are inferred\nfrom them. This finding can be understood if one assumes that the conversion\nfactor between CO luminosity and H2 mass is much larger in these low\nmetallicity systems than in nearby molecular clouds. However, it is unclear\nwhether this is the only factor at work, or whether the star formation rate of\nthe clouds is directly sensitive to the metallicity of the gas.\n  To investigate this, we have performed numerical simulations of the coupled\ndynamical, chemical and thermal evolution of model clouds with metallicities\nranging from 0.01 Z_solar to Z_solar. We find that the star formation rate in\nour model clouds has little sensitivity to the metallicity. Reducing the\nmetallicity of the gas by two orders of magnitude delays the onset of star\nformation in the clouds by no more than a cloud free-fall time and reduces the\ntime-averaged star formation rate by at most a factor of two. On the other\nhand, the chemical state of the clouds is highly sensitive to the metallicity,\nand at the lowest metallicities, the clouds are completely dominated by atomic\ngas. Our results confirm that the CO-to-H2 conversion factor in these systems\ndepends strongly on the metallicity, but also show that the precise value is\nhighly time-dependent, as the integrated CO luminosity of the most metal-poor\nclouds is dominated by emission from short-lived gravitationally collapsing\nregions. Finally, we find evidence that the star formation rate per unit H2\nmass increases with decreasing metallicity, owing to the much smaller H2\nfractions present in our low metallicity clouds.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 12\n"}

We present a radio\ncontinuum survey of all z<1 GRB hosts in The Optically Unbiased GRB Host\n(TOUGH) sample supplemented with radio data for all (mostly pre-Swift) GRB-SN\nhosts discovered before October 2006. We present new radio data for 22 objects\nand have obtained a detection for three of them (GRB 980425, 021211, 031203;\nnone in the TOUGH sample), increasing the number of radio-detected GRB hosts\nfrom two to five. The star formation rate (SFR) for the GRB 021211 host of ~825\nMo yr^-1, the highest ever reported for a GRB host, places it in the category\nof ultraluminous infrared galaxies. We found that at least 63% of GRB hosts\nhave SFR < 100 Mo yr^-1 and at most 8% can have SFR > 500 Mo yr^-1. For the\nundetected hosts the mean radio flux (<35 uJy 3sigma) corresponds to an average\nSFR < 15 Mo yr^-1. Moreover, ~88% of the z<1 GRB hosts have ultraviolet dust\nattenuation A_UV < 6.7 mag (visual attenuation A_V < 3 mag). Hence we did not\nfind evidence for large dust obscuration in a majority of GRB hosts. Finally,\nwe found that the distributions of SFRs and A_UV of GRB hosts are consistent\nwith those of Lyman break galaxies, Halpha emitters at similar redshifts and of\ngalaxies from cosmological simulations. The similarity of the GRB population\nwith other star-forming galaxies is consistent with the hypothesis that GRBs, a\nleast at z<1, trace a large fraction of all star formation, and are therefore\nless biased indicators than once thought.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 12\n"}

In general, the proton flux has higher increments at lower energy bands\ncompared with the ambient solar wind. Inside the BL, the core electron flux\nincreases quasi-isotropically and the increments decrease monotonously with\nenergy from ~30% (at 18 eV) to ~10% (at 70 eV); the suprathermal electron flux\nusually increases in either parallel or antiparallel direction; the correlation\ncoefficient of electron flux variations in parallel and antiparallel directions\nchanges sharply from ~0.8 below 70 eV to ~0 above 70 eV.

This particular approach has the conceptual advantage of\nrelating the gluon mass directly to quantities that are intrinsic to the\nbound-state formation itself, such as the \"transition amplitude\" and the\ncorresponding \"bound-state wave-function\". As a result, the dynamical evolution\nof the gluon mass is largely determined by a Bethe-Salpeter equation that\ncontrols the dynamics of the relevant wave-function, rather than the\nSchwinger-Dyson equation of the gluon propagator, as happens in the standard\ntreatment. The precise structure and field-theoretic properties of the\ntransition amplitude are scrutinized in a variety of independent ways. In\nparticular, a parallel study within the linear covariant (Landau) gauge and the\nbackground-field method reveals that a powerful identity, known to be valid at\nthe level of conventional Green's functions, relates also the background and\nquantum transition amplitudes. Despite the differences in the ingredients and\nterminology employed, the massless bound-state formalism is absolutely\nequivalent to the standard approach based on Schwinger-Dyson equations.

The mathematical and physical arguments Ingoli\npresents are largely the anti-Copernican arguments of the great Danish\nastronomer Tycho Brahe; one of these (an argument based on measurements of the\napparent sizes of stars) was all but unanswerable. Ingoli's emphasis on the\nscientific arguments of Brahe, and his lack of emphasis on theological\narguments, raises the question of whether the condemnation of the Copernican\ntheory was, in contrast to how it is usually viewed, essentially scientific in\nnature, following the ideas of Brahe.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 12\n"}
{"prompt": "  In a recent paper we claimed that there there are no slowly rotating,\nstationary, axisymmetric black holes in the infrared limit of Horava-Lifshitz\ngravity, provided that they are regular everywhere apart from the central\nsingularity. Here we point out a subtlety in the equivalence between\nEinstein-aether theory and the infrared limit of Horava-Lifshitz gravity which\nwas missed in our earlier derivation and drastically modifies our conclusion:\nour earlier calculations (which are otherwise technically correct) do not\nreally imply that there are no slowly rotating black holes in Horava-Lifshitz\ngravity, but that there are no slowly rotating black holes in the latter that\nare also solutions of Einstein-aether theory and vice versa. That is, even\nthough the two theories share the static, spherically symmetric solutions,\nthere are no slowly rotating black holes that are solutions to both theories.\nWe proceed to generate slowly rotating black hole solutions in the infrared\nlimit of Horava-Lifshitz gravity, and we show that the configuration of the\nfoliation-defining scalar remains the same as in spherical symmetry, thus these\nblack holes are expected to posses a universal horizon.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 12\n"}
{"prompt": "  We present two algorithms that compute the Newton polytope of a polynomial\ndefining a hypersurface H in C^n using numerical computation. The first\nalgorithm assumes that we may only compute values of f - this may occur if f is\ngiven as a straight-line program, as a determinant, or as an oracle. The second\nalgorithm assumes that H is represented numerically via a witness set. That is,\nit computes the Newton polytope of H using only the ability to compute\nnumerical representatives of its intersections with lines. Such witness set\nrepresentations are readily obtained when H is the image of a map or is a\ndiscriminant. We use the second algorithm to compute a face of the Newton\npolytope of the L\\\"uroth invariant, as well as its restriction to that face.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 12\n"}

{"prompt": "  This paper develops generalizations of empowerment to continuous states.\nEmpowerment is a recently introduced information-theoretic quantity motivated\nby hypotheses about the efficiency of the sensorimotor loop in biological\norganisms, but also from considerations stemming from curiosity-driven\nlearning. Empowemerment measures, for agent-environment systems with stochastic\ntransitions, how much influence an agent has on its environment, but only that\ninfluence that can be sensed by the agent sensors. It is an\ninformation-theoretic generalization of joint controllability (influence on\nenvironment) and observability (measurement by sensors) of the environment by\nthe agent, both controllability and observability being usually defined in\ncontrol theory as the dimensionality of the control/observation spaces. Earlier\nwork has shown that empowerment has various interesting and relevant\nproperties, e.g., it allows us to identify salient states using only the\ndynamics, and it can act as intrinsic reward without requiring an external\nreward. However, in this previous work empowerment was limited to the case of\nsmall-scale and discrete domains and furthermore state transition probabilities\nwere assumed to be known. The goal of this paper is to extend empowerment to\nthe significantly more important and relevant case of continuous vector-valued\nstate spaces and initially unknown state transition probabilities. The\ncontinuous state space is addressed by Monte-Carlo approximation; the unknown\ntransitions are addressed by model learning and prediction for which we apply\nGaussian processes regression with iterated forecasting. In a number of\nwell-known continuous control tasks we examine the dynamics induced by\nempowerment and include an application to exploration and online model\nlearning.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 12\n"}
{"prompt": "  We propose a method for generating high-fidelity multipartite\nspin-entanglement of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice in a short operation\ntime with a scalable manner, which is suitable for measurement-based quantum\ncomputation. To perform the desired operations based on the perturbative\nspin-spin interactions, we propose to actively utilize the extra degrees of\nfreedom (DOFs) usually neglected in the perturbative treatment but included in\nthe Hubbard Hamiltonian of atoms, such as, (pseudo-)charge and orbital DOFs.\nOur method simultaneously achieves high fidelity, short operation time, and\nscalability by overcoming the following fundamental problem: enhancing the\ninteraction strength for shortening operation time breaks the perturbative\ncondition of the interaction and inevitably induces unwanted correlations among\nthe spin and extra DOFs.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 12\n"}
{"prompt": "  We report an angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy investigation of the\nFermi surface and electronic band structure of BaCo$_{2}$As$_2$. Although its\nquasi-nesting-free Fermi surface differs drastically from that of its\nFe-pnictide cousins, we show that the BaCo$_{2}$As$_2$ system can be used as an\napproximation to the bare unoccupied band structure of the related\nBaFe$_{2-x}$Co$_x$As$_2$ and Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ compounds. However,\nour experimental results, in agreement with dynamical mean field theory\ncalculations, indicate that electronic correlations are much less important in\nBaCo$_{2}$As$_2$ than in the ferropnictides. Our findings suggest that this\neffect is due to the increased filling of the electronic 3$d$ shell in the\npresence of significant Hund's exchange coupling.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 12\n"}
{"prompt": "  We present a regularized logistic regression model for evaluating player\ncontributions in hockey. The traditional metric for this purpose is the\nplus-minus statistic, which allocates a single unit of credit (for or against)\nto each player on the ice for a goal. However, plus-minus scores measure only\nthe marginal effect of players, do not account for sample size, and provide a\nvery noisy estimate of performance. We investigate a related regression\nproblem: what does each player on the ice contribute, beyond aggregate team\nperformance and other factors, to the odds that a given goal was scored by\ntheir team? Due to the large-p (number of players) and imbalanced design\nsetting of hockey analysis, a major part of our contribution is a careful\ntreatment of prior shrinkage in model estimation. We showcase two recently\ndeveloped techniques -- for posterior maximization or simulation -- that make\nsuch analysis feasible. Each approach is accompanied with publicly available\nsoftware and we include the simple commands used in our analysis. Our results\nshow that most players do not stand out as measurably strong (positive or\nnegative) contributors.

{"prompt": "  In the current paper, we analyzed the variation of cosmic radiation flux with\nelevation, time of the year and ambient temperature with the help of a portable\ncosmic muon detector, the construction of which was completed by a team from\nSouthern Arkansas University (SAU) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\n(LBNL). Cosmic muons and gamma rays traverse two synchronized scintillators\nconnected to two photomultiplier tubes (PMT) via light guides, and generate\nelectronic pulses which we counted using a Data Acquisition Board (DAQ).\nBecause muons are the product of collisions between high-energy cosmic rays and\natmospheric nuclei, and therefore shower onto earth, the scintillators were\narranged horizontally for detection. The elevation measurements were recorded\nat different locations, starting from 60 feet below sea-level at the\nUnderground Radiation Counting Laboratory at Johnson Space Center, TX, to 4200\nfeet at Mt. Hamilton, CA. Intermediate locations included sea-level Galveston\nBay, TX, and Mt. Magazine, AR (2800 feet). The data points showed a noticeable\nincrease in flux as elevation increases, independent of latitude. Measurements\ninvestigating the dependence of cosmic rays on temperature and time of the year\ntook place locally in Magnolia, AR. We found that cosmic muon flux is uniform,\nappears to be independent of conditions on earth, and is anti-correlative with\ntemperature. We are convinced that the sun has minimal to zero effect on\ncosmic-ray flux; it cannot be a major contributing source of this background\nradiation. The source of cosmic radiation remains one of the biggest unanswered\nquestions in physics today.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 12\n"}
{"prompt": "  Let $k$ be a perfect field of odd characteristic $p$ and $X_0$ a smooth\nconnected algebraic variety over $k$ which is assumed to be $W_2(k)$-liftable.\nIn this short note we associate a de Rham bundle to a nilpotent Higgs bundle\nover $X_0$ of exponent $n\\leq p-1$ via the exponential function.

Instead, we show the equivalence of the association with that of\nSheng-Xin-Zuo in the geometric case. The construction relies on the cocycle\nproperty of the difference of different Frobenius liftings over $W_2(k)$, which\nplays the key role in the proof of $E_1$-degeration of the Hodge to de Rham\nspectral sequence of $X_0$ due to P.

{"prompt": "  We investigate the temporal and spectral correlations between flux and\nanisotropy fluctuations of TeV-band cosmic rays in the light of recent data\ntaken with IceCube.

Moreover, even for a shallow distribution\nof galactic cosmic-ray sources and a reacceleration model, fluctuations arising\nfrom source discreteness provide a probability only of the order of 10% that\nthe cosmic-ray anisotropy limits of the recent IceCube analysis are met. This\nprobability estimate is nearly independent of the exact choice of source rate,\nbut generous for a large halo size.

{"prompt": "  The results are presented of anelastic and dielectric spectroscopy\nmeasurements on large grain ceramic PZT with compositions near the two\nmorphotropic phase boundaries (MPBs) that the ferroelectric (FE) rhombohedral\nphase has with the Zr-rich antiferroelectric and Ti-rich FE tetragonal phases.\nThese results are discussed together with similar data from previous series of\nsamples, and reveal new features of the phase diagram of PZT, mainly connected\nwith octahedral tilting and its coupling with the polar modes. Additional\nevidence is provided of what we interpret as the onset of the tilt instability,\nwhen is initially frustrated by lattice disorder, and the long range order is\nachieved at lower temperature. Its temperature T_IT(x) prosecutes the long\nrange tilt instability line T_T(x) up to T_C, when T_T. It is proposed that the\ndifficulty of seeing the expected 1/2<111> modulations in diffraction\nexperiments is due to the large correlation volume associated with that type of\ntilt fluctuations combined with strong lattice disorder. It is shown that the\nlines of the tilt instabilities tend to be attracted and merge with those of\npolar instabilities. Not only T_IT bends toward T_C and then merges with it,\nbut in our series of samples the temperature T_MPB of the dielectric and\nanelastic maxima at the rhombohedral/tetragonal MPB does not cross T_T, but\ndeviates remaining parallel or possibly merging with T_T. These features,\ntogether with a similar one in NBT-BT, are discussed in terms of cooperative\ncoupling between tilt and FE instabilities, which may trigger a common phase\ntransition. An analogy is found with recent simulations of the tilt and FE\ntransitions in multiferroic BiFeO3. An abrupt change is found in the shape of\nthe anelastic anomaly at T_T when x passes from 0.465 to 0.48, possibly\nindicative of a rhombohedral/monoclinic boundary.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 12\n"}
