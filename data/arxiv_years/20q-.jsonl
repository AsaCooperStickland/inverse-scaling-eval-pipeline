{"prompt": "  The Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) is a recently developed machine learning\nframework capable of building simple models from large sets of candidate\nfeatures. Here, we describe a protocol for using the RVM to explore very large\nnumbers of candidate features, and a family of models which apply the power of\nthe RVM to classifying and detecting interesting points and regions in\nbiological sequence data. The models described here have been used successfully\nfor predicting transcription start sites and other features in genome\nsequences.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20q-"}
{"prompt": "  It has long been hypothesized that futile cycles in cellular metabolism are\ninvolved in the regulation of biochemical pathways. Following the work of\nNewsholme and Crabtree, we develop a quantitative theory for this idea based on\nopen-system thermodynamics and metabolic control analysis. It is shown that the\n{\\it stoichiometric sensitivity} of an intermediary metabolite concentration\nwith respect to changes in steady-state flux is governed by the effective\nequilibrium constant of the intermediate formation, and the equilibrium can be\nregulated by a futile cycle. The direction of the shift in the effective\nequilibrium constant depends on the direction of operation of the futile cycle.\nHigh stoichiometric sensitivity corresponds to ultrasensitivity of an\nintermediate concentration to net flow through a pathway; low stoichiometric\nsensitivity corresponds to super-robustness of concentration with respect to\nchanges in flux. Both cases potentially play important roles in metabolic\nregulation. Futile cycles actively shift the effective equilibrium by expending\nenergy; the magnitude of changes in effective equilibria and sensitivities is a\nfunction of the amount of energy used by a futile cycle. This proposed\nmechanism for control by futile cycles works remarkably similarly to kinetic\nproofreading in biosynthesis. The sensitivity of the system is also intimately\nrelated to the rate of concentration fluctuations of intermediate metabolites.\nThe possibly different roles of the two major mechanisms for cellular\nbiochemical regulation, namely reversible chemical modifications via futile\ncycles and shifting equilibrium by macromolecular binding, are discussed.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20q-"}
