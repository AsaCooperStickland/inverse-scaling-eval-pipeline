{"prompt": "  Brane Box Models of intersecting NS and D5 branes are mapped to D3 branes at\nC^3/Gamma orbifold singularities and vise versa, in a setup which gives rise to\nN=1 supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions. The Brane Box Models are\nconstructed on a two-torus. The map is interpreted as T-duality along the two\ndirections of the torus. Some Brane Box Models contain NS fivebranes winding\naround (p,q) cycles in the torus, and our method provides the geometric T-dual\nto such objects. An amusing aspect of the mapping is that T-dual configurations\nare calculated using D=4 N=1 field theory data. The mapping to the singularity\npicture allows the geometrical interpretation of all the marginal couplings in\nfinite field theories. This identification is further confirmed using the\nAdS/CFT correspondence for orbifold theories. The AdS massless fields coupling\nto the marginal operators in the boundary appear as stringy twisted sectors of\nS^5/Gamma.

Both experimental and\ntheoretical approaches seem to say that there is a natural frequency range\nassociated with intermolecular motions in liquids, typically spanning no more\nthan a few hundred cm^{-1}. Landau-Teller-like theories explain how a solvent\ncan absorb any vibrational energy within this \"band\", but how is it that\nmolecules can rid themselves of superfluous vibrational energies significantly\nin excess of these values? We develop a theory for such processes based on the\nidea that the crucial liquid motions are those that most rapidly modulate the\nforce on the vibrating coordinate -- and that by far the most important of\nthese motions are those involving what we have called the mutual nearest\nneighbors of the vibrating solute. Specifically, we suggest that whenever there\nis a single solvent molecule sufficiently close to the solute that the solvent\nand solute are each other's nearest neighbors, then the instantaneous\nscattering dynamics of the solute-solvent pair alone suffices to explain the\nhigh frequency relaxation. The many-body features of the liquid only appear in\nthe guise of a purely equilibrium problem, that of finding the likelihood of\nparticularly effective solvent arrangements around the solute.

One attractive\npossibility -- suggested by baryonic dark cluster formation in pregalactic and\nprotogalactic cooling flows -- is that the inner halo is dominated by stellar\nmass objects, whereas low mass brown dwarfs become more prevalent on moving\noutwards. The contribution to the microlensing rate must be dominated by dark\nremnants (of about 0.5 solar masses) to recover the observed timescales of the\nmicrolensing experiments.

Unfortunately, both the effects of\nactions and the information returned from sensors are subject to error. To cope\nwith such uncertainties, the agent can maintain probabilistic beliefs about the\nstate of the world. With probabilistic beliefs the agent will be able to\nquantify the likelihood of the various outcomes of its actions and is better\nable to utilize the information gathered from its error-prone actions and\nsensors. In this paper, we present a model in which we can reason about an\nagent's probabilistic degrees of belief and the manner in which these beliefs\nchange as various actions are executed. We build on a general logical theory of\naction developed by Reiter and others, formalized in the situation calculus. We\npropose a simple axiomatization that captures an agent's state of belief and\nthe manner in which these beliefs change when actions are executed.

At\nthe Plank scale, there exists a quantized, absolute 3D space and separate\n(quantized) time which is not affected by motion or gravity. Light is the\nsimple shifting of a photon information pattern from cell to adjacent cell at\nevery CA 'clock cycle'. The Lorentz transformation is derived from our simple\nmodel of light motion. Inertial mass is revised to acknowledge the absolute\nnature of mass and acceleration. The same electromagnetic quantum vacuum forces\nare also present in masses inside a gravitational field, where now the quantum\nvacuum is accelerated with respect to the mass by graviton exchanges. This\nprocess is responsible for the equivalence principle (WEP), which is derived in\ndetail. Gravity is found to be based on two boson force exchange particles: the\ngraviton and the photon, and both particles are postulated to be almost\nidentical in physical characteristics. 4D space-time curvature is found to\nresult from a 'Fizeau-like' scattering process, where the accelerated\n(electrically charged) virtual particles of the quantum vacuum act like a\nspecial 'Fizeau fluid'.

Roughly put, this states that if two Calabi-Yau manifolds X and Y\nare mirror partners, then X and Y have special Lagrangian torus fibrations\nwhich are dual to each other. Much work on this conjecture is necessarily of a\nspeculative nature, as in dimension 3 it is still a very difficult problem of\nhow to construct such fibrations. Nevertheless, assuming the existence of such\nfibrations there are many things one can prove. This paper covers a number of\nissues. First it applies results from the theory of completely integrable\nhamiltonian systems to understand some aspects of the geometry of such\nfibrations. From this, using reasonable regularity assumptions on the\nfibrations, one can understand how the cohomology of dual fibrations are\nrelated. We then study the question of how, given one such fibration, one would\nput a symplectic and complex structure on the dual fibrations, generalising\nwork of Hitchin. While this question cannot be answered at this stage, these\nresults should give insight into the nature of the problem. We sum up these\nideas in a refined version of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture.\n  Finally, to give evidence for this conjecture, we prove it explicitly for K3\nsurfaces.

In contrast to the\nnaive expectation that the total n+d scattering cross section is the sum of two\nNN cross sections we find two additional effects resulting from rescattering\nprocesses. These additional terms have different signs (shadowing and\nantishadowing) and a different behavior as function of the energy. Our\nderivation of these results which are already known from Glauber theory is\nbased on the analytical evaluation of elastic transition amplitudes in the high\nenergy limit. It does not depend on the diffraction type assumptions connected\nwith Glauber theory. In this model of spinless Yukawa type forces (with no\nabsorption) the total n+d cross section does not approach twice the NN total\ncross section in the high energy limit but rather approaches the total NN cross\nsection multiplied by a number larger than two.

{"prompt": "  The study of primordial chemistry of molecules adresses a number of\ninteresting questions pertaining to the thermal balance of collapsing molecular\nprotoclouds. In numerous astrophysical cases molecular cooling and heating\ninfluence dynamical evolution of the medium. The existence of a significant\nabundance of molecules can be crucial on the dynamical evolution of collapsing\nobjects. Because the cloud temperature increases with contraction, a cooling\nmechanism can be important for the structure formation, by lowering pressure\nopposing gravity, i.e. by allowing continued collapse of Jeans unstable\nprotoclouds. This is particularly true for the first generation of objects. It\nhas been suggested that a finite amount of molecules such as $H_2$, $HD$ and\n$LiH$ can be formed immediately after the recombination of cosmological\nhydrogen (Lepp and Shull 1984, Puy et al 1993). The cosmological fractional\nabundance $HD/H_2$ is small. Nevertheless, the presence of a non-zero permanent\nelectric dipole moment makes $HD$ a potentially more important coolant than\n$H_2$ at modest temperatures, although $HD$ is much less abundant than $H_2$.\nRecently Puy and Signore (1997) showed that during the early stages of\ngravitational collapse, for some collapsing masses, $HD$ molecules were the\nmain cooling agent when the collapsing protostructure had a temperature of\nabout 200 Kelvins.

In weak\nfields we predict novel flux periodic oscillations in the spin component along\nthe quantization axis with a periodicity given by $\\nu h/e$ ($\\nu \\le 1$). The\nsensitivity of the calculated persistent current to interaction and disorder is\nshown to reflect the intricacies of various Mott-Hubbard quantum phase\ntransitions in two- dimensional systems: the persistent current is suppressed\nin the antiferromagnetic Mott-insulating phase governed by intradot Coulomb\ninteractions; the persistent current is maximized at the spin density wave -\ncharge density wave transition driven by the nearest neighbor interdot\ninteraction; the Mott-insulating phase persistent current is enhanced by the\nlong-range interdot interactions to its noninteracting value; the strong\nsuppression of the noninteracting current in the presence of random disorder is\nseen only at large disorder strengths; at half filling even a relatively weak\nintradot Coulomb interaction enhances the disordered noninteracting system\npersistent current; in general, the suppression of the persistent current by\ndisorder is less significant in the presence of the long-range interdot Coulomb\ninteraction.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 98\n"}

Somewhat less certain are intensities in the same\nenergy range from cosmic rays escaping from normal galaxies or active galactic\nnuclei (AGN) and interacting with intracluster gas.

{"prompt": "  A recent paper by King and Ritter (1998: hereafter KR) proposed that the\nlight curves of soft X-ray transients (SXTs) are dominated by the effect of\nirradiation of the accretion disc by the central X-rays. This prevents the\nonset of the cooling wave which would otherwise return the disc to the\nquiescent state, and so prolongs the outbursts beyond those in dwarf nova\ndiscs. KR show that the decay of the resulting X-ray light curve should be\nexponential or linear depending on whether or not the observed peak X-ray\nluminosity is sufficient to ionize the outer edge of the accretion disc. Here\nwe examine the observed X-ray decays, and show that they are exponential or\nlinear according as the peak luminosity is greater or smaller than the critical\nvalue defined by KR, strongly suggesting that the light curves are indeed\nirradiation--dominated. We show further that the occurrence of an exponential\nor linear decay tends to favour the same type of decay in subsequent outbursts,\nso that systems usually show only one or the other type. We use the equations\nof KR and the observed X-ray light curve to determine the size $R_{h}$ of the\nhot disc at the peak of the outburst. For exponential decays, $R_{h}$ is found\nto be comparable to the circularization radius, as expected since the disc\nconsists entirely of material transferred from the secondary since the previous\noutburst. Further, $R_h$ is directly proportional to the time at which one sees\nthe secondary maximum ($t_{s}$), as expected if $t_{s}$ is the viscous\ntimescale of the irradiated disc. This implies that the orders of magnitude of\nthe viscosity parameter alpha and disc aspect ratio H/R are such that alpha\n(H/R)~0.01.

A discussion on selection techniques, biases and binning\neffects explains the differences between these results.

In the 3-D position space, well known\nopen clusters (Hyades, Coma Berenices and Ursa Major), associations (parts of\nthe Scorpio-Centaurus association) as well as the Hyades evaporation track are\nretrieved. Three new probably loose clusters are identified (Bootes, Pegasus 1\nand 2). The sample is relatively well mixed in the position space since less\nthan 7 per cent of the stars belong to structures with coherent kinematics,\nmost likely gravitationally bound. In the velocity space, the majority of large\nscale velocity structures ($\\sigma$ ~ 6.3 $km s-1$) are Eggen's superclusters\n(Pleiades SCl, Hyades SCl and Sirius SCl) with the whole Centaurus association.\nA new supercluster-like structure is found with a mean velocity between the Sun\nand Sirius SCl velocities. These structures are all characterized by a large\nage range which reflects the overall sample age distribution. Moreover, a few\nold streams of ~ 2 Gyr are also extracted at this scale with high U components.\nWe show that all these large velocity dispersion structures represent 46% of\nthe sample.

The maximum entropy method is used\nto determine the probability distributions of the final state pions (or $\\rho$\nmesons) for a given mean multiplicity, mean transverse momentum and mean total\nenergy. Event simulation based on our model is performed in two extreme cases,\na $\\pi$-model and a $\\rho$-model. The $\\pi$-model assumes that only pions are\nproduced directly. On the other hand, the $\\rho$-model assumes that only $\\rho$\nmesons are produced directly and they decay into pions.

As a result\nit is possible to combine the solution of the CCP with: a) inflation and\ntransition to a $\\Lambda =0$ phase without fine tuning after a reheating\nperiod; b) spontaneously broken gauge unified theories (including fermions).\nThe model opens new possibilities for a solution of the hierarchy problem.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 98\n"}

With our earlier published I-band CCD and high S/N-ratio 21cm HI\ndata (Lu et al. 1993), this paper completes our optical surface photometry\ncampaign on this galaxy sample. As an application of this data set, the B-band\nphotometry is used here to illustrate two selection effects which have been\nsomewhat overlooked in the literature, but which may be important in deriving\nthe distribution function of disk central surface brightness (CSB) of disk\ngalaxies from a diameter or/and flux limited sample: a Malmquist-type bias\nagainst disk galaxies with small disk scale lengths (DSL) at a given CSB; and a\ndisk inclination dependent selection effect that may, for example, bias toward\ninclined disks near the threshold of a diameter limited selection if disks are\nnot completely opaque in optical. Taking into consideration these selection\neffects, we present a method of constructing a volume sampling function and a\nway to interpret the derived distribution function of CSB and DSL. Application\nof this method to our galaxy sample implies that if galaxy disks are optically\nthin, CSB and DSL may well be correlated in the sense that, up to an\ninclination-corrected limiting CSB of about 24.5 mag per square arcsec that is\nadequately probed by our galaxy sample, the DSL distribution of galaxies with a\nlower CSB may have a longer tail toward large values unless the distribution of\ndisk galaxies as a function of CSB rises rapidly toward faint values.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 98\n"}

A congestion control scheme helps the\nnetwork to recover from the congestion state while a congestion avoidance\nscheme allows a network to operate in the region of low delay and high\nthroughput with minimal queuing, thereby preventing it from entering the\ncongested state in which packets are lost due to buffer shortage.\n  A number of possible alternatives for congestion avoidance were identified.\n  From these alternatives we selected one called the binary feedback scheme in\nwhich the network uses a single bit in the network layer header to feed back\nthe congestion information to its users, which then increase or decrease their\nload to make optimal use of the resources. The concept of global optimality in\na distributed system is defined in terms of efficiency and fairness such that\nthey can be independently quantified and apply to any number of resources and\nusers.\n  The proposed scheme has been simulated and shown to be globally efficient,\nfair, responsive, convergent, robust, distributed, and\nconfiguration-independent.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 98\n"}

In this paper we investigate the relevance\nof small non-linear effects and point out their impact on the sensitivity curve\nof interferometric gravitational wave detectors (e.g. VIRGO, LIGO, GEO, ...)\nthrough perturbative methods and numerical simulations. We find that in the\nfirst order approximation the constants characterizing the power spectrum\ndensity (PSD) are renormalized but it retains its typical shape. This is due to\nthe fact that the involved Feynman diagrams are of tadpole type. Higher order\napproximations are required to give rise to up-conversion effects. This result\nis predicted by the perturbative approach and is in agreement with the\nnumerical results obtained by studying the system's non-linear response by\nnumerically simulating its dynamics.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 98\n"}

{"prompt": "  In the unified schemes for extragalactic radio sources, the quasars and BL\nLac objects are intrinsically similar to the Fanaroff-Riley class II and I\nradio galaxies respectively, but appear to be different because they are viewed\nat different angles to the line-of-sight. The quasars and BL Lac objects are\nobserved at small viewing angles while the radio galaxies lie close to the\nplane of the sky. In such schemes, the quasar or BL Lac nucleus is hidden from\nour view by a putative torus when the source is inclined at a large angle to\nthe line-of-sight and appears as a radio galaxy. Such a scenario should also\naffect the observed polarization properties of the cores, with the cores in the\nradio galaxies and weak-cored quasars being less polarized than the\ncore-dominated quasars and BL Lacs due to Faraday depolarization by the\nmagnetoionic medium in the obscuring torus or disk.

{"prompt": "  I study the zero temperature phase transition between superfluid and\ninsulating ground states of the Bose-Hubbard model in a random chemical\npotential and at large integer average number of particles per site. Duality\ntransformation maps the pure Bose-Hubbard model onto the sine-Gordon theory in\none dimension (1D), and onto the three dimensional Higgs electrodynamics in two\ndimensions (2D). In 1D the random chemical potential in dual theory couples to\nthe space derivative of the dual field, and appears as a random magnetic field\nalong the imaginary time direction in 2D. I show that the transition from the\nsuperfluid state in both 1D and 2D is always controlled by the random critical\npoint. This arises due to a coupling constant in the dual theory with replicas\nwhich becomes generated at large distances by the random chemical potential,\nand represents a relevant perturbation at the pure superfluid-Mott insulator\nfixed point. At large distances the dual theory in 1D becomes equivalent to the\nHaldane's macroscopic representation of disordered quantum fluid, where the\ngenerated term is identified with random backscattering. In 2D the generated\ncoupling corresponds to the random mass of the complex field which represents\nvortex loops.

For spectral types considered here, the\ncorrections are small and independent of the assumed ionization parameter.\nUsing the results of these photoionization models, we find [Al/S]_i = -1.0 in\nthe ionized gas towards three disk stars. These values of [Al/S]_i (=[Al/H]_i)\nimply that Al-bearing grains are present in the ionized nebulae around these\nstars. If the WIM of the Galaxy is photoionized by OB stars, our data for two\nhalo stars imply [Al/S]_i = -0.4 to -0.5 in the WIM and thus the presence of\ndust grains containing Al in this important phase of the ISM. While\nphotoionization appears to be the most likely origin of the ionization for Al\nIII and S III, we cannot rule out confusion from the presence of hot,\ncollisionally ionized gas along two sightlines.

As soon as the detection\nof the possible GRB 970111 X-ray afterglow was reported by Feroci et al. (1998)\nwe reanalyzed the optical data collected for the GRB 970111 field. Although we\ndetect small magnitude variability in some objects, no convincing optical\ncounterpart is found inside the WFC error box. Any change in brightness 19\nhours after the GRB is less than 0.2 mag for objects with B < 21 and R < 20.8.\n  The bluest object found in the field is coincident with 1SAXJ1528.8+1937.\nSpectroscopic observations revealed that this object is a Seyfert-1 galaxy with\nredshift z=0.657, which we propose as the optical counterpart of the X-ray\nsource.\n  Further observations allowed to perform multicolour photometry for objects in\nthe GRB 970111 error box. The colour-colour diagrams do not show any object\nwith unusual colours. We applied a photometric classification method to the\nobjects inside the GRB error box, that can distinguish stars from galaxies and\nestimate redshifts. We were able to estimate photometric redshifts in the range\n0.2 < z < 1.4 for several galaxies in this field and we did not find any\nconspicuous unusual object.\n  We note that GRB 970111 and GRB 980329 could belong to the same class of\nGRBs, which may be related to nearby sources (z ~1) in which high intrinsic\nabsorption leads to faint optical afterglows.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 98\n"}
{"prompt": "  On any manifold M^n, the de Rham operator D=d+d^* (with respect to a complete\nRiemannian metric), with the grading of forms by parity of degree, gives rise\nby Kasparov theory to a class [D] in KO_0(M), which when M is closed maps to\nthe Euler characteristic chi(M) in KO_0(point) = Z. The purpose of this note is\nto give a quick proof of the (perhaps unfortunate) fact that [D] is as trivial\nas it could be subject to this constraint. More precisely, if M is connected,\n[D] lies in the image of Z = KO_0(point) in KO_0(M) (induced by the inclusion\nof a basepoint).\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 98\n"}
{"prompt": "  We estimate the dipole of the diffuse 1.5 keV X-ray background from the ROSAT\nall-sky survey map of Snowden et al (1995). We first subtract the diffuse\nGalactic emission by fitting to the data an exponential scale height, finite\nradius, disk model. We further exclude regions of low galactic latitudes, of\nlocal X-ray emission (eg the North Polar Spur) and model them using two\ndifferent methods. We find that the ROSAT X-ray background (XRB) dipole points\ntowards $(l,b) ~ (288, 25) \\pm 19 degrees within 30 degrees of the CMB dipole.\nIts direction is also in good agreement with the HEAO1 X-ray dipole at harder\nenergies. The normalised amplitude of the ROSAT XRB dipole is about 1.7 per\ncent. Subtracting from the ROSAT map the expected X-ray background dipole due\nto the reflex motion of the observer with respect to the cosmic rest frame\n(Compton-Geting effect) we find the large-scale dipole of the X-ray emitting\nextragalactic sources having an amplitude 90% of the total XRB, in general\nagreement with the predictions of Lahav et al (1997). We finally estimate that\nthe Virgo cluster is responsible for about 20 per cent of the total measured\nXRB dipole amplitude.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 98\n"}
