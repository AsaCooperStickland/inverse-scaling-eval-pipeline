{"prompt": "  Geometric Invariant Theory gives a method for constructing quotients for\ngroup actions on algebraic varieties which in many cases appear as moduli\nspaces parametrizing isomorphism classes of geometric objects (vector bundles,\npolarized varieties, etc.). The quotient depends on a choice of an ample\nlinearized line bundle. Two choices are equivalent if they give rise to\nidentical quotients. A priori, there are infinitely many choices since there\nare infinitely many isomorphism classes of linearized ample line bundles. Hence\nseveral fundamental questions naturally arise. Is the set of equivalence\nclasses, and hence the set of non-isomorphic quotients, finite? How does the\nquotient vary under change of the equivalence class? In this paper we give\npartial answers to these questions in the case of actions of reductive\nalgebraic groups on nonsingular projective algebraic varieties. We shall show\nthat among ample line bundles which give projective geometric quotients there\nare only finitely many equivalence classes. These classes span certain convex\nsubsets (chambers) in a certain convex cone in Euclidean space; and when we\ncross a wall separating one chamber from another, the corresponding quotient\nundergoes a birational transformation which is similar to a Mori flip.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 94"}

If the magnetic part is ignored, then the newtonian\nlimit of the relativistic equations is reduced to the closed set of the local\nLagrangian equations. Recently this fact drew much attention since the\ngravitational instability in that form would greatly simplify the study of\ncosmic structure formation.

The dynamics of the jet/cloud interaction is strongly\naffected by the cooling in the shocked gas behind the bow shock at the head of\nthe jet. We show that this cooling is very rapid, with the cooling distance of\nthe gas much less than the jet radius. Thus, although ambient gas is initially\ndriven away from the jet axis by the high thermal pressure odf the post-shock\ngas, rapid cooling reduces the pressure and the outflow subsequently evolves in\na momentum-conserving snowplow fashion. The velocity of the ambient gas is high\nin the vicinity of the jet head, but decreases rapidly as more material is\nswept up. Thus, this type of outflow produces extremely high velocity clumps of\npost shock gas which resemble the features seen in outflows. We have\ninvestigated the transfer of momentum from the jet to the ambient medium as a\nfunction of the jet parameters. We show that a low Mach number (<6) jet slows\ndown rapidly because it entrains ambient material along its sides. On the other\nhand, the beam of a high Mach number jet is separated from the ambient gas by a\nlow density cocoon of post-shock gas, and this jet transfers momentum to the\nambient medium principally at the bow-shock. In high Mach number jets, as those\nfrom young stellar objects, the dominant interaction is therefore at the bow\nshock at the head of the jet.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 94"}

Resonant excitations of these\ng-modes during the last few minutes of the binary coalescence result in energy\ntransfer and angular momentum transfer from the binary orbit to the neutron\nstar. The angular momentum transfer is possible because a dynamical tidal lag\ndevelops even in the absence of fluid viscosity. However, since the coupling\nbetween the g-mode and the tidal potential is rather weak, the amount of energy\ntransfer during a resonance and the induced orbital phase error are very small.\nResonant excitations of the g-modes play an important role in tidal heating of\nbinary neutron stars. Without the resonances, viscous dissipation is effective\nonly when the stars are close to contact. The resonant oscillations result in\ndissipation at much larger orbital separation.

The dynamics of\nthe ellipsoid is set by the ellipsoid self-gravity and the external quadrupole\nshear. Both forces are linear in the coordinates and therefore maintain\nhomogeneity of the ellipsoid at all times. The amplitude of the external shear\nis evolved into the non-linear regime in thin spherical shells that are allowed\nto move only radially according to the mass interior to them. We describe how\nthe initial conditions can be drawn in the appropriate correlated way from a\nrandom field of initial density perturbations. By considering many random\nrealizations of the initial conditions, we calculate the distribution of shapes\nand angular momenta acquired by objects through the coupling of their\nquadrupole moment to the tidal shear.

The model depends on only few parameters and\ncan be constrained by observations. Thus we are able to show that radio and\nX-ray fluxes (SSC emission) of cores and lobes and typical dimensions of radio\nloud quasars are consistent with a jet being produced in the central engine. We\npresent a synthetic broadband spectrum from radio to X-ray for a jet-disk\nsystem. The only way to explain the high efficiency of radio loud objects is to\npostulate that these objects consist of `maximal jets' with `total\nequipartition' where the magnetic energy flow of the jet is comparable to the\nkinetic jet power and the total jet power is a large fraction of the disk\npower.

Consequently, low power radio quasars\nwould either be classified as radio galaxies (FR I) or strongly core-boosted\n(BL Lac) object, depending on the aspect angle, and no conspicuous transitional\npopulation would be expected for FR I sources. A closing torus with decreasing\npower would not only obscure the optical nucleus for most aspect angles but\nwould also enhance the entrainment of the cool torus material into the jet\nstream, causing obscuration along the jet's periphery, as well as the jet's\ndeceleration to form a FR I source.

{"prompt": "  Distribution functions of relative velocities among particles in a vibrated\nbed of powder are studied both numerically and theoretically. In the solid\nphase where granular particles remain near their local stable states, the\nprobability distribution is Gaussian. On the other hand, in the fluidized\nphase, where the particles can exchange their positions, the distribution\nclearly deviates from Gaussian. This is interpreted with two analogies;\naggregation processes and soft-to-hard turbulence transition in thermal\nconvection. The non-Gaussian distribution is well-approximated by the\nt-distribution which is derived theoretically by considering the effect of\nclustering by inelastic collisions in the former analogy.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 94"}

A Bayesian posterior probability criterion is\nused to determine which states to merge and when to stop generalizing. The\nprocedure may be considered a heuristic search for the HMM structure with the\nhighest posterior probability. We discuss a variety of possible priors for\nHMMs, as well as a number of approximations which improve the computational\nefficiency of the algorithm.

{"prompt": "  We apply a recent proposal for defining states and observables in quantum\ngravity to simple models. First, we consider a Klein-Gordon particle in an ex-\nternal potential in Minkowski space and compare our proposal to the theory ob-\ntained by deparametrizing with respect to a time slicing prior to quantiza-\ntion. We show explicitly that the dynamics of the deparametrization approach\ndepends on the time slicing. Our proposal yields a dynamics independent of the\nchoice of time slicing at intermediate times but after the potential is turned\noff, the dynamics does not return to the free particle dynamics. Next we apply\nour proposal to the closed Robertson-Walker quantum cosmology with a massless\nscalar field with the size of the universe as our time variable, so the only\ndynamical variable is the scalar field. We show that the resulting theory has\nthe semi-classical behavior up to the classical turning point from expansion to\ncontraction, i.e., given a classical solution which expands for much longer\nthan the Planck time, there is a quantum state whose dynamical evolution\nclosely approximates this classical solution during the expansion. However,\nwhen the \"time\" gets larger than the classical maximum, the scalar field be-\ncomes \"frozen\" at its value at the maximum expansion. We also obtain similar\nresults in the Taub model. In an Appendix we derive the form of the Wheeler-\nDeWitt equation for the Bianchi models by performing a proper quantum reduc-\ntion of the momentum constraints; this equation differs from the usual one ob-\ntained by solving the momentum constraints classically, prior to quantization.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 94"}

Such a collapse\nis described by the Tolman-Bondi metric which has two free functions: the\n`mass-function' and the `energy function', which are determined by the initial\ndensity and velocity profile of the cloud. The collapse can end in a black-hole\nor a naked singularity, depending on the initial parameters characterizing\nthese profiles. In the marginally bound case, we find that the collapse ends in\na naked singularity if the leading non-vanishing derivative of the density at\nthe center is either the first one or the second one. If the first two\nderivatives are zero, and the third derivative non-zero, the singularity could\neither be naked or covered, depending on a quantity determined by the third\nderivative and the central density. If the first three derivatives are zero,\nthe collapse ends in a black hole. In particular, the classic result of\nOppenheimer and Snyder, that homogeneous dust collapse leads to a black hole,\nis recovered as a special case. Analogous results are found when the cloud is\nnot marginally bound, and also for the case of a cloud starting from rest. We\nalso show how the strength of the naked singularity depends on the density and\nvelocity distribution. Our analysis generalizes and simplifies the earlier work\nof Christodoulou and Newman [4,5] by dropping the assumption of evenness of\ndensity functions.

The amplitudes of the interference maxima are\nchanged by a factor which depends upon a double line integral of the photon\ntwo-point function around the closed path of the electrons. The interference\npattern is sensitive to shifts in the vacuum fluctuations in regions from which\nthe electrons are excluded. Thus this effect combines aspects of both the\nCasimir and the Aharonov-Bohm effects. The coupling to the quantized\nelectromagnetic field tends to decrease the amplitude of the interference\noscillations, and hence is a form of decoherence.

It is\nto be expected that photon emission leads to decoherence, as it can reveal\nwhich path an electron takes. It is less obvious that vacuum fluctuations also\ncan cause decoherence.

Topological Yang-Mills theory with $G=SU(2)$ is not just\nDonaldson theory, but contains a certain {\\sl link} theory.

Being BRST\nexact in any interior point of ${\\cal M}$ is not sufficient to make an\namplitude vanish. Presumably, recursion relations and hierarchies can be found\nto solve topological field theories in four dimensions, in particular\ntopological Yang-Mills theory with $G=SU(2)$ on ${\\bf R}^4$ and topological\ngravity on ALE manifolds.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 94"}
