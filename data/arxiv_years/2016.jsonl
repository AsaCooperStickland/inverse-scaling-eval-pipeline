The novelty of these processes is that one begins with a clean\npicture at the quark level which allows one to select the basic mechanisms by\nmeans of which the process proceeds. Finally, one has a final state described\nin terms of quarks. To make contact with the experiments, where mesons and\nbaryons are observed, one must hadronize, creating pairs of $q \\bar q$ and\nwriting the new states in terms of mesons and baryons. This concludes the\nprimary hadron production in these processes. After that, the interaction of\nthese hadrons takes place, offering a rich spectrum of resonances and special\nfeatures from where it is possible to learn much about the interaction of these\nhadrons and the nature of many resonances in terms of the components of their\nwave functions.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2016"}

This paper investigates the optimal consensus problem for\ngeneral linear MASs subject to control input constraints. Two classes of MASs\nincluding subsystems with semi-stable and unstable dynamics are considered. For\nboth classes of MASs without input constraints, the results on designing\noptimal consensus protocols are first developed by inverse optimality approach.\nUtilizing the optimal consensus protocols, the receding horizon control\n(RHC)-based consensus strategies are designed for these two classes of MASs\nwith input constraints. The conditions for assigning the cost functions\ndistributively are derived, based on which the distributed RHC-based consensus\nframeworks are formulated. Next, the feasibility and consensus properties of\nthe closed-loop systems are analyzed. It is shown that 1) the optimal\nperformance indices under the inverse optimal consensus protocols are coupled\nwith the network topologies and the system matrices of subsystems, but they are\ndifferent for MASs with semi-stable and unstable subsystems; 2) the unstable\nmodes of subsystems impose more stringent requirements for the parameter\ndesign; 3) the designed RHC-based consensus strategies can make the control\ninput constraints fulfilled and ensure consensus for the closed-loop systems in\nboth cases.

Here, we study the role played by non-linear spiral patterns\nwithin hydrodynamical and non self-gravitating accretion disc assuming that\nexternal disturbances such as infall onto the disc may trigger them. To do so,\nwe computed self-similar solutions that describe discs in which a spiral wave\npropagates. Such solutions present both shocks and critical sonic points that\nwe carefully analyze. For all allowed temperatures and for several spiral\nshocks, we calculated the wave structure. In particular we inferred the angle\nof the spiral patern, the stress it exerts on the disc as well as the\nassociated flux of mass and angular momentum as a function of temperature. We\nquantified the rate of angular momentum transport by means of the dimensionless\n$\\alpha$ parameter.

Methods: We perform three-dimensional simulations of\nstratified fully compressible magnetohydrodynamic convection in rotating\nspherical wedges at various thermal and magnetic Prandtl numbers (from 0.25 to\n2 and 5, respectively). Results: We find that the rotation profiles for high\nthermal diffusivity show a monotonically increasing angular velocity from the\nbottom of the convection zone to the top and from the poles toward the equator.\nFor sufficiently rapid rotation, a region of negative radial shear develops at\nmid-latitudes as the thermal diffusivity is decreased. This coincides with a\nchange in the dynamo mode from poleward propagating activity belts to\nequatorward propagating ones. Furthermore, the cyclic solutions disappear at\nthe highest magnetic Reynolds numbers. The total magnetic energy increases with\nthe magnetic Reynolds number in the range studied here ($5-151$), but the\nenergies of the mean magnetic fields level off at high magnetic Reynolds\nnumbers.

Here we present experiments in which microwave electric field driving\ninduces transitions between both valley-orbit and spin states. We show that\nthis system is highly nonlinear and can be understood through the use of\ndressed photon-orbital states, enabling a unified understanding of the six\nmicrowave resonance lines we observe. Some of these resonances are inter-valley\nspin transitions that arise from a non-adiabatic process in which both the\nvalley and the spin degree of freedom are excited simultaneously. For these\ntransitions, involving a change in valley-orbit state, we find a tenfold\nincrease in sensitivity to electric fields and electrical noise compared to\npure spin transitions, strongly reducing the phase coherence when changes in\nvalley-orbit index are incurred. In contrast to this non-adiabatic transition,\nthe pure spin transitions, whether arising from harmonic or subharmonic\ngeneration, are shown to be adiabatic in the orbital sector. The non-linearity\nof the system is most strikingly manifest in the observation of a dynamical\nanti-crossing between a spin-flip, inter-valley transition and a three-photon\ntransition enabled by the strong nonlinearity we find in this seemly simple\nsystem.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2016"}

A simple excluded volume argument\npredicts the sign and magnitude of the Gaussian curvature modulus that is in\nagreement with experimental measurements. Our results provide insight into how\nthe interplay between membrane elasticity, geometrical frustration and achiral\nsymmetry breaking can be used to fold colloidal membranes into 3D shapes.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2016"}
{"prompt": "  Several massive early-type binaries exhibit non-thermal emission which has\nbeen attributed to synchrotron radiation from particles accelerated by\ndiffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in the wind-collision region (WCR). If the\nmagnetic field in the strong shocks is ordered, its component parallel to the\nshock front should be enhanced, and the resultant synchrotron radiation would\nbe polarized. However, such polarization has never been measured. We performed\nspatially-unresolved radio continuum observations of WR 146, a well known a\nWC6+O8 system, at 5 cm and 20 cm with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. No\nlinearly polarized radio emission was detected. The data constrain the\nfractional linear polarization to less than 0.6% between 1 to 8 GHz. This is\ncompatible with a high level of turbulence and a dominant random component in\nthe magnetic field. In this case the relativistic particles could be produced\nby turbulent magnetic reconnection (MR). In order for this scenario to satisfy\nthe required non-thermal energy budget, we find through numerical modeling that\nthe strength of the magnetic field in the WCR must be as high as ~150 mG.\nHowever, if the magnetic field is ordered and DSA is ongoing, then a\ncombination of internal and external Faraday rotation could equally account for\nthe depolarization of the emission. It is not clear whether it is possible to\ndevelop the high level of turbulence and strong magnetic fields required for\nefficient MR in a long-period binary such as WR 146. This scenario might also\nhave trouble explaining the low-frequency cutoff in the spectrum. We therefore\nfavor a scenario where particles are accelerated through DSA and the\ndepolarization is produced by mechanisms other than a large ratio between\nrandom to regular magnetic fields.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2016"}

{"prompt": "  The Lovasz Local Lemma (LLL) is a probabilistic tool which has been used to\nshow the existence of a variety of combinatorial structures with good \"local\"\nproperties. The \"LLL-distribution\" can be used to show that the resulting\nstructures have good global properties in expectation.\n  The simplest, variable-based setting of the LLL was covered by the seminal\nalgorithm of Moser & Tardos (2010). This has since been extended to other\nprobability spaces including random permutations. One can similarly define an\n\"MT-distribution\" for these algorithms, that is, the distribution of the\nconfiguration they produce. Haeupler et al. (2011) showed bounds on the\nMT-distribution which essentially match the LLL-distribution for the\nvariable-assignment setting; Harris & Srinivasan showed similar results for the\npermutation setting.\n  In this work, we show new bounds on the MT-distribution which are\nsignificantly stronger than those known to hold for the LLL-distribution. In\nthe variable-assignment setting, we show a tighter bound on the probability of\na disjunctive event or singleton event. As a consequence, in $k$-SAT instances\nwith bounded variable occurrence, the MT-distribution satisfies an\n$\\epsilon$-approximate independence condition asymptotically stronger than the\nLLL-distribution. We use this to show a nearly tight bound on the minimum\nimplicate size of a CNF boolean formula. Another noteworthy application is\nconstructing independent transversals which avoid a given subset of vertices;\nthis provides a constructive analogue to a result of Rabern (2014).\n  In the permutation LLL setting, we show a new type of bound which is similar\nto the cluster-expansion LLL criterion of Bissacot et al. (2011), but is\nstronger and takes advantage of the extra structure in permutations. We\nillustrate with improved bounds on weighted Latin transversals and partial\nLatin transversals.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2016"}

{"prompt": "  Inference in expressive probabilistic models is generally intractable, which\nmakes them difficult to learn and limits their applicability. Sum-product\nnetworks are a class of deep models where, surprisingly, inference remains\ntractable even when an arbitrary number of hidden layers are present. In this\npaper, we generalize this result to a much broader set of learning problems:\nall those where inference consists of summing a function over a semiring. This\nincludes satisfiability, constraint satisfaction, optimization, integration,\nand others. In any semiring, for summation to be tractable it suffices that the\nfactors of every product have disjoint scopes. This unifies and extends many\nprevious results in the literature. Enforcing this condition at learning time\nthus ensures that the learned models are tractable. We illustrate the power and\ngenerality of this approach by applying it to a new type of structured\nprediction problem: learning a nonconvex function that can be globally\noptimized in polynomial time. We show empirically that this greatly outperforms\nthe standard approach of learning without regard to the cost of optimization.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2016"}
{"prompt": "  Many natural and manmade dynamical systems that are modeled as large\nnonlinear multi-oscillator systems like power systems are hard to analyze. For\nsuch a system, we propose a nonlinear modal decoupling (NMD) approach inversely\nconstructing as many decoupled nonlinear oscillators as the system oscillation\nmodes so that individual decoupled oscillators can easily be analyzed to infer\ndynamics and stability of the original system. The NMD follows a similar idea\nto the normal form except that we eliminate inter-modal terms but allow\nintra-modal terms of desired nonlinearities in decoupled systems, so decoupled\nsystems can flexibly be shaped into desired forms of nonlinear oscillators. The\nNMD is then applied to power systems towards two types of nonlinear\noscillators, i.e. the single-machine-infinite-bus (SMIB) systems and a proposed\nnon-SMIB oscillator. Numerical studies on a 3-machine 9-bus system and New\nEngland 10-machine 39-bus system show that (i) decoupled oscillators keep a\nmajority of the original system modal nonlinearities and the NMD provides a\nbigger validity region than the normal form, and (ii) decoupled non-SMIB\noscillators may keep more authentic dynamics of the original system than\ndecoupled SMIB systems.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2016"}
{"prompt": "  As radiofrequency filtering plays a vital role in electromagnetic devices and\nsystems, recently photonic techniques have been intensively studied to\nimplement radiofrequency filters to harness wide frequency coverage, large\ninstantaneous bandwidth, low frequency-dependent loss, flexible tunability and\nstrong immunity to electromagnetic interference. However, one crucial challenge\nfacing the photonic radiofrequency filter (PRF) is the less impressive\nout-of-band rejection. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we demonstrate a\ntunable PRF with a record out-of-band rejection of 80 dB, which is 3 dB higher\nthan the maximum value (~77 dB) reported so far, when incorporating highly\nselective polarization control and large narrow-band amplification enabled by\nstimulated Brillouin scattering effect. In particular, this record rejection is\narduous to be achieved for a narrow passband (e.g., a few megahertz) and a high\nfinesse in a PRF. Moreover, the proposed PRF is an active one capable of\nproviding negligible insertion loss and even signal gain. Tunable central\nfrequency ranging from 2.1 to 6.1 GHz is also demonstrated.
