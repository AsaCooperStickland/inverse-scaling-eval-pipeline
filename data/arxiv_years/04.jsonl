We argue\nthat a distinction can be made between equilibrated staged freeze-out in which\npost-formation hadron interactions play an important role in determining\nfinal-state observables, and non-equilibrium sudden freeze-out where spectra\nand abundances get determined at the same time and further interactions are\nnegligible. We attempt to falsify sudden freeze-out by examining whether\nparticle abundances and spectra can be described using the same formation\ntemperature. This is done both in the equilibrium framework, and using a\nchemical non-equilibrium ansatz. Our fits to experimental data suggest that the\nsudden freeze-out model explains both the particle abundances and spectra.

We discuss observed resonances and suggest further measurements\nthat have the potential to distinguish between the possible freeze-out\nscenarios experimentally. Finally, we infer from experimental data how particle\nformation proceeds in spacetime, in particular whether freeze-out dynamics\nagrees with the sudden freeze-out expectation.

{"prompt": "  BL Lacertae was the target of an extensive multiwavelength monitoring\ncampaign in the second half of 2000. In this paper, we are using leptonic and\nhadronic jet models to fit the observed broadband spectra and spectral\nvariability patterns. We start out with global spectral models. Subsequently,\nwe investigate various flaring scenarios for comparison with the observed\nshort-term variability. For our leptonic jet model, we find that the short-term\nvariability, in particular the optical and X-ray spectral variability, can be\nbest represented with a flaring scenario dominated by a spectral-index change\nof the spectrum of ultrarelativistic electrons injected into the jet. Based on\nthis result, a detailed model simulation, reproducing the observed optical and\nX-ray spectral variability and broadband SED of BL Lacertae simultaneously, is\npresented. Our leptonic modeling results are compared to fits using the\nhadronic synchrotron-proton blazar (SPB) model. That model can reproduce the\nobserved SEDs of BL Lacertae in a scenario with muon-synchrotron dominated\nhigh-energy emission.

The\nevolution of winds is investigated by following the expansion of supernova\ndriven superbubbles around the several hundred thousand galaxies that form in\nan approximately spherical region of space with diameter 52 Mpc/h and mean\ndensity close to the mean density of the Universe. We focus our attention on\nthe impact of winds on the diffuse intergalactic medium. Initial conditions for\nmass loss at the base of winds are taken from Shu, Mo and Mao (2003). Results\nare presented for the volume filling factor and the mass fraction of the IGM\naffected by winds and their dependence on the model parameters is carefully\ninvestigated. The mass loading efficiency of bubbles is a key factor to\ndetermine the evolution of winds and their global impact on the IGM: the higher\nthe mass loading, the later the IGM is enriched with metals. Galaxies with 10^9\n< M_* < 10^10 M_sun are responsible for most of the metals ejected into the IGM\nat z=3, while galaxies with M_* < 10^9 M_sun give a non negligible contribution\nonly at higher redshifts, when larger galaxies have not yet assembled.

{"prompt": "  A two-dimensional fluid, stirred at high wavenumbers and damped by both\nviscosity and linear friction, is modeled by a statistical field theory. The\nfluid's long-distance behavior is studied using renormalization-group (RG)\nmethods, as begun by Forster, Nelson, and Stephen [Phys. Rev. A 16, 732\n(1977)]. With friction, which dissipates energy at low wavenumbers, one expects\na stationary inverse energy cascade for strong enough stirring. While such\ndeveloped turbulence is beyond the quantitative reach of perturbation theory, a\ncombination of exact and perturbative results suggests a coherent picture of\nthe inverse cascade. The zero-friction fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) is\nderived from a generalized time-reversal symmetry and implies zero anomalous\ndimension for the velocity even when friction is present. Thus the Kolmogorov\nscaling of the inverse cascade cannot be explained by any RG fixed point. The\nbeta function for the dimensionless coupling ghat is computed through two\nloops; the ghat^3 term is positive, as already known, but the ghat^5 term is\nnegative. An ideal cascade requires a linear beta function for large ghat,\nconsistent with a Pad\\'e approximant to the Borel transform. The conjecture\nthat the Kolmogorov spectrum arises from an RG flow through large ghat is\ncompatible with other results, but the accurate k^{-5/3} scaling is not\nexplained and the Kolmogorov constant is not estimated. The lack of scale\ninvariance should produce intermittency in high-order structure functions, as\nobserved in some but not all numerical simulations of the inverse cascade. When\nanalogous RG methods are applied to the one-dimensional Burgers equation using\nan FDT-preserving dimensional continuation, equipartition is obtained instead\nof a cascade--in agreement with simulations.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 04\n"}

The shell of X-ray-emitting gas\nis hotter than the ambient ISM, and overpressured by a factor of 100.

The material released from these comets could be (after\nionization) an important portion of the inner source of pickup ions (PUIs), as\nthe local mass flux of the inner source and cometary PUIs seem comparable.

In this formalism we can clearly 1) delineate the validity of\ncosmological effective actions in an expanding universe. The corollary of the\ninitial state ambiguity is the existence of an earliest time. The inability of\nan effective action to describe physics before this time demands that one sets\ninitial conditions on the earliest time hypersurface. A calculation then shows\nthat CMB anisotropy measurements are generically sensitive to high energy\ncorrections to the initial conditions. 2) We compute the one-loop contribution\nto the stress-tensor due to high-energy physics corrections to an arbitrary\ncosmological initial state. We find that phenomenological bounds on the\nbackreaction do not lead to strong constraints on the coefficient of the\nleading boundary irrelevant operator. Rather, we find that the power spectrum\nitself is the quantity most sensitive to initial state corrections. 3) The\ncomputation of the one-loop backreaction confirms arguments that irrelevant\ncorrections to the Bunch-Davies initial state yield non-adiabatic vacua\ncharacterized by an energy excess at some earlier time. However, this excess\nonly dominates over the classical background at times before the `earliest\ntime' at which the effective action is valid.

A brief discussion of\nuseful ancillary data from other sources and remaining challenges concludes the\nreport.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 04\n"}

{"prompt": "  A new scenario for neutron-star cooling is proposed, based on the\ncorrespondence between pion condensation, occurring in neutron matter due to\ncritical spin-isospin fluctuations, and the metal-insulator phase transition in\na two-dimensional electron gas. Beyond the threshold density for pion\ncondensation, where neutron-star matter loses its spatial homogeneity, the\nneutron single-particle spectrum acquires an insulating gap that quenches\nneutron contributions to neutrino-production reactions and to the star's\nspecific heat. In the liquid phase at densities below the transition point,\nspin-isospin fluctuations are found to play dual roles. On the one hand, they\nlead to a multi-sheeted neutron Fermi surface that extends to low momenta,\nthereby activating the normally forbidden direct-Urca cooling mechanism; on the\nother, they amplify the nodeless $P$-wave neutron superfluid gap while\nsuppressing $S$-wave pairing. In this picture, lighter stars without a\npion-condensed core experience slow cooling, while enhanced cooling occurs in\nheavier stars through direct-Urca emission from a narrow shell of the interior.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 04\n"}

At low energies, this happens for $^4$He, but not for\n$^3$He where contributions from the two stronger modes are comparable so that\nacceleration of $^3$He is very efficient.

In fact, integration time is the primary metric in evaluating\nvarious design approaches for the high contrast imaging system. In this paper\nwe present a new approach to determining the existence of a planet in an\nobserved system using Bayesian hypothesis testing. Rather than perform\nphotometry, or rely on vision to determine the existence of a planet, this\napproach evaluates the image plane data statistically under certain assumptions\nabout the prior probability distributions. We show that extremely high\nconfidence can be achieved in substantially shorter integration times than\nconventional photometric methods.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 04\n"}

For\nrealistic parameters for hybridization as well as 4f^1 and 4f^3 levels, these\nsinglet and triplet can form a nearly degenerate pseudo-quartet. It is found\nthat one of two spin 1/2 objects composing the pseudo-quartet has a\nferromagnetic exchange, while the other has an antiferromagnetic exchange with\nconduction electrons. The magnitude of each effective exchange depends strongly\non a parameter characterizing the triplet wave function under the T_h symmetry.\nIt is argued that differences of this parameter among Pr skutterdudites are\nresponsible for the apparent diversity of their physical properties. Numerical\nrenormalization group is used to derive the renormalization flows going toward\nsinglet, doublet, triplet or quaret according to the CEF splitting and exchange\ninteractions.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 04\n"}

Therefore, we performed two-dimensional\nhydrodynamical simulations for flat multi-component disks embedded in a stellar\nand dark matter potential. The pressure-free dust component is coupled to the\ngas by a drag force depending on their velocity difference.\n  It turned out that the most unstable regions are those with either a low or\nnear to minimum Toomre parameter or with rigid rotation, i.e. the central area.\nIn that regions the dust-free disks become most unstable for a small range of\nhigh azimuthal modes (m \\sim 8), whereas in dusty disks all modes have similar\namplitudes resulting in a patchy appearance. The structures in the dust have a\nlarger contrast between arm and inter-arm regions than those of the gas.

{"prompt": "  A new classification of neutron star cooling scenarios, involving either\n``minimal'' cooling or ``enhanced'' cooling is proposed. The minimal cooling\nscenario replaces and extends the so-called standard cooling scenario to\ninclude neutrino emission from the Cooper pair breaking and formation process.\nThis emission dominates that due to the modified Urca process for temperatures\nclose to the critical temperature for superfluid pairing. Minimal cooling is\ndistinguished from enhanced cooling by the absence of neutrino emission from\nany direct Urca process, due either to nucleons or to exotica. Within the\nminimal cooling scenario, theoretical cooling models can be considered to be a\nfour parameter family involving the equation of state of dense matter,\nsuperfluid properties of dense matter, the composition of the neutron star\nenvelope, and the mass of the neutron star. Consequences of minimal cooling are\nexplored through extensive variations of these parameters. Results are compared\nwith the inferred properties of thermally-emitting neutron stars in order to\nascertain if enhanced cooling occurs in any of them. All stars for which\nthermal emissions have been clearly detected are at least marginally consistent\nwith the lack of enhanced cooling. The two pulsars PSR 0833-45 (Vela) and PSR\n1706-44 would require enhanced cooling in case their ages and/or temperatures\nare on the lower side of their estimated values whereas the four stars PSR\n0656+14, PSR 1055-52, Geminga, and RX J0720.4-3125 may require some source of\ninternal heating in case their age and/or luminosity are on the upper side of\ntheir estimated values.

{"prompt": "  This is a brief account of our numerical study of the tearing mode\nreconnection. We demonstrate two main points. First, we show that, given\nsufficiently small resistivity, the Rutherford regime always exists; larger\nvalues of Delta' require smaller values of resistivity.

Second, we find that, at large Delta', the Rutherford\nregime is followed by a nonlinear stage of fast growth linked to X-point\ncollapse and formation of a current sheet. This causes the reconnection to\nbecome Sweet-Parke (SP) like. The signature resistivity^{1/2} scaling of the\neffective island growth rate is, indeed, found in this nonlinear stage. The SP\nstage culminates in the saturation of the mode, which can, thus, be achieved\nmuch faster than via Rutherford regime.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 04\n"}

The temporal evolution of the vertex deviation is considered in detail.\nIt is shown that the vertex deviation does not seem to depend strongly on the\nage of the stellar group.

This\nphase coexistence occurs in ordered arrangement alternating periodic terrace\nsteps. We present here a method to study the surface morphology throughout this\ntransition by means of specular and diffuse scattering of soft x-rays, tuning\nthe photon energy at the Mn 2p resonance.

The concentration of vacancies\nis greater than equilibrium concentrations in order to simulate conditions\nshortly after ion implantation.

Additionally, long range interactions are shown to be of critical\nimportance in KLMC simulations; when shorter interaction ranges are considered\nonly clusters composed entirely of vacancies form. An increase in arsenic\ndiffusivity for arsenic concentrations up to $10^{19} \\text{cm}^{-3}$ is\nobserved, along with a decrease in arsenic diffusivity for higher arsenic\nconcentrations, due to the formation of arsenic dominated clusters.

{"prompt": "  We demonstrate that periodic modulation of the nonlinearity coefficient in\nthe discrete nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger (DNLS) equation can strongly facilitate\ncreation of traveling solitons in the lattice. We predict this possibility in\nan analytical form, and test it in direct simulations. Systematic simulations\nreveal several generic dynamical regimes, depending on the amplitude and\nfrequency of the time modulation, and on initial thrust which sets the soliton\nin motion. These regimes include irregular motion, regular motion of a decaying\nsoliton, and regular motion of a stable one. The motion may occur in both the\nstraight and reverse directions, relative to the initial thrust. In the case of\nstable motion, extremely long simulations in a lattice with periodic boundary\nconditions demonstrate that the soliton keeps moving as long as we can monitor\nwithout any visible loss. Velocities of moving stable solitons are in good\nagreement with the analytical prediction, which is based on requiring a\nresonance between the ac drive and motion of the soliton through the periodic\npotential. All the generic dynamical regimes are mapped in the model's\nparameter space. Collisions between moving stable solitons are briefly\ninvestigated too, with a conclusion that two different outcomes are possible:\nelastic bounce, or bounce with mass transfer from one soliton to the other.

The suggestion is also made\nthat quantum theory unwittingly emerged, in Schroedinger's formulation, as a\n'lossy' by-product of a quantum-mechanical variant of the Hamilton-Jacobi\nequation. As it turns out, the effectiveness of quantum theory qua predictive\nalgorithm makes up for the computational impracticability of that master\nequation.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 04\n"}

As a result, if the\nbeam radii are adjusted so diffraction losses per bounce are about 10 ppm,\nreplacing Gaussian beams by mesa beams reduces the thermoelastic noise power by\nabout a factor 3. If other thermal noises are kept negligible, this will permit\nadvanced LIGO to beat the Standard Quantum Limit by about a factor 1.5 over a\nbandwidth about equal to frequency, and the event rate for inspiraling neutron\nstar binaries will increase by about a factor 2.5.

{"prompt": "  We have studied the effects of an hypothetical initial generation containing\nvery massive stars (M > 100 Msun, pair-creation SNe) on the chemical and\nphotometric evolution of elliptical galaxies. To this purpose, we have computed\nthe evolution of a typical elliptical galaxy with luminous mass of the order of\n10^11 Msun and adopted chemical evolution models already tested to reproduce\nthe main features of ellipticals. We have tested several sets of yields for\nvery massive zero-metallicity stars: these stars should produce quite different\namounts of heavy elements than lower mass stars. We found that the effects of\npopulation III stars on the chemical enrichment is negligible if only one or\ntwo generations of such stars occurred, whereas they produce quite different\nresults from the standard models if they continuously formed for a period not\nshorter than 0.1 Gyr. In this case, the results are at variance with the main\nobservational constraints of ellipticals such as the average [<alpha/Fe>] ratio\nin stars and the integrated colors. Therefore, we conclude that if population\nIII stars ever existed they must have been present for a very short period of\ntime and their effects on the following evolution of the parent galaxy must\nhave been negligible. This effect is minimum if a more realistic model with\ninitial infall of gas rather than the classic monolithic model is adopted.\nUltimately, we conclude that there is no need to invoke a generation of very\nmassive stars in ellipticals to explain their chemical and photometric\nproperties.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 04\n"}

Specifically, we follow the evolution\nof the dynamic heterogeneity as the temperature dependence of the transport\ncoefficients shows a crossover from non-Arrhenius to Arrhenius behavior when\nthe melt is cooled. It is demonstrated that, on intermediate time scales, a\nsmall fraction of oxygen and silicon atoms are more mobile than expected from a\nGaussian approximation. These highly mobile particles form transient clusters\nlarger than that resulting from random statistics, indicating that dynamics are\nspatially heterogeneous. An analysis of the clusters reveals that the mean\ncluster size is maximum at times intermediate between ballistic and diffusive\nmotion, and the maximum size increases with decreasing temperature. In\nparticular, the growth of the clusters continues when the transport\ncoefficients follow an Arrhenius law. These findings imply that the structural\nrelaxation in silica cannot be understood as a statistical bond breaking\nprocess. Though the mean cluster sizes for silica are at the lower end of the\nspectrum of values reported in the literature, we find that spatially\nheterogeneous dynamics in strong and fragile glass formers are similar on a\nqualitative level.

The problem is\nformulated in a finite domain where the appropriate conservation law yields\nRobin conditions at the ends.

We resolve\nthis by defining the exit concentration as a solution to a similar diffusion\nequation which satisfies a Dirichlet condition at the left end of the half\nline. This problem does not appear to have been solved in the literature, and\nthe resulting representation should be useful for problems of practical\ninterest. Authors of previous works on problems of this type have eliminated\nthe unknown exit concentration by assuming a continuous concentration at the\noutflow boundary.

Compact Stern layers on the\nelectrodes are also taken into account. The Nernst-Planck-Poisson equations are\nfirst linearized and solved by Laplace transforms for small voltages, and\nnumerical solutions are obtained for large voltages. The ``weakly nonlinear''\nlimit of thin double layers is then analyzed by matched asymptotic expansions\nin the small parameter $\\epsilon = \\lambda_D/L$, where $\\lambda_D$ is the\nscreening length and $L$ the electrode separation. At leading order, the system\ninitially behaves like an RC circuit with a response time of $\\lambda_D L / D$\n(not $\\lambda_D^2/D$), where $D$ is the ionic diffusivity, but nonlinearity\nviolates this common picture and introduce multiple time scales.

We find\nthat the betweenness centrality (BC) criterion is useful for identifying hubs\nwhich are most likely to cause congestion, and that the addition of assortative\nconnections to hubs of high BC relieves congestion most efficiently.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 04\n"}
{"prompt": "  Lepton flavor violating Higgs boson decays are studied within the context of\nseesaw models with Majorana massive neutrinos. Two models are considered: The\nSM-seesaw, with the Standard Model Particle content plus three right handed\nneutrinos, and the MSSM-seesaw, with the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model\nparticle content plus three right handed neutrinos and their supersymmetric\npartners. The widths for these decays are derived from a full one-loop\ndiagrammatic computation in both models, and they are analyzed numerically in\nterms of the seesaw parameters, namely, the Dirac and Majorana mass matrices.\nSeveral possible scenarios for these mass matrices that are compatible with\nneutrino data are considered. In the SM-seesaw case, very small branching\nratios are found for all studied scenarios. These ratios are explained as a\nconsequence of the decoupling behaviour of the heavy right handed neutrinos. In\ncontrast, in the MSSM-seesaw case, sizeable branching ratios are found for some\nof the leptonic flavor violating decays of the MSSM neutral Higgs bosons and\nfor some choices of the seesaw matrices and MSSM parameters. The relevance of\nthe two competing sources of lepton flavor changing interactions in the\nMSSM-seesaw case is also discussed. The non-decoupling behaviour of the\nsupersymmetric particles contributing in the loop-diagrams is finally shown.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 04\n"}
{"prompt": "  We study analytically and numerically the evolution of bound systems in\nuniverses with accelerating expansion where the acceleration either increases\nwith time towards a Big Rip singularity (phantom cosmologies) or decreases with\ntime (quintessence). We confirm the finding of Caldwell et. al.\n[arXiv:astro-ph/0302506] (hereafter CKW) that bound structures get dissociated\nin phantom cosmologies but we demonstrate that this happens earlier than\nanticipated by CKW. In particular we find that the `rip time' when a bound\nsystem gets unbounded is not the time when the repulsive phantom energy\ngravitational potential due to the average $(\\rho + 3p)$ balances the\nattractive gravitational potential of the mass M of the system. Instead, the\n`rip time' is the time when the minimum of the time dependent effective\npotential (including the centrifugal term) disappears. For the Milky Way galaxy\nthis happens approximately 180Myrs before the Big Rip singularity instead of\napproximately 60Myrs indicated by CKW for a phantom cosmology with w=-1.5.

{"prompt": "  The possibility of appearance of spin polarized states in symmetric and\nstrongly asymmetric nuclear matter is analyzed within the framework of a Fermi\nliquid theory with the Skyrme effective interaction.

By comparing free energy densities, it is\nshown that in symmetric nuclear matter ferromagnetic spin state (parallel\norientation of neutron and proton spins) is more preferable than\nantiferromagnetic one (antiparallel orientation of spins).

In comparison with\nneutron matter, even small admixture of protons strongly decreases the\nthreshold density of spin instability.

Thus, only neutron stars and small\nblack holes of few solar masses are encompassed by our analysis. The\ncontributions to the SNR given by final merge and quasi-normal ringing are\nneglected. It is identified that i) the reduction in the mirror thermal noise\nband provides the highest gain for the SNR, when the VIRGO bandwidth is divided\naccording to the dominant noises; ii) it exists a specific frequency at which\nlies the potential largest increment in the SNR, and that the enlargement of\nthe bandwidth, where the noise is reduced, produces a shift of such optimal\nfrequency to higher values; iii) the abatement of the pendulum thermal noise\nprovides the largest, but modest, gain, when noise sources are considered\nseparately.
