{"prompt": "  Based on the IUE SWP spectra obtained between 1978 and 1994, the variations\nof the UV continuum and the Ly-alpha and C IV emission lines of the broad-line\nradio galaxy 3C390.3 are studied. The UV continuum between 1220 and 1990 A has\nvaried considerably. In 1991 August, the flux at 1360 A reached a maximum level\n~27 times as high as its minimum level. At 1850 A, the continuum varies by a\nfactor of ~12. Significant variations are frequently observed in periods as\nshort as one month. The total flux of Ly-alpha and C IV emission varies by a\nfactor of ~5. Their profiles are fitted with one narrow component, unresolved\nat the instrumental resolution of FWHM ~2000 km/s, and three broad components\n(FWHM ~6000 km/s). The narrow component varies by a factor of ~2.5. The broad\ncomponents on the blue and red wings of the Ly-alpha and C IV emission profile,\nwhich correspond to the double humps in the H-alpha and H-beta emission\nfeature, display a close correlation to the varying continuum, with a time lag\nof ~45 days. The blue Ly-alpha component has been stronger than the red\ncomponent except for several epochs in 1980 and 1991. The C IV/Ly-alpha flux\nratio is ~0.4 for the narrow component. For the broad components, this ratio\nvaries considerably around an average value of unity. In 1991 March, the blue\nLy-alpha component was stronger than the red, while for C IV the red component\nwas stronger. Such differential variations do not match the accretion disk\ncharacteristics. The findings suggest that the narrow- and broad-line region in\n3C 390.3 may be associated with a radio jet.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 96"}

The enhanced\nrelaxation arises because the radial and azimuthal orbital frequencies in a\nKeplerian potential are equal, and hence may be termed {\\em resonant\nrelaxation}. We explore the dynamics of resonant relaxation using both\nnumerical simulations and order-of-magnitude analytic calculations. We find\nthat the resonant angular momentum relaxation time is shorter than the\nnon-resonant relaxation time by of order $M_\\star/M$, where $M_\\star$ is the\nmass in stars and $M$ is the mass of the central object. Resonance does not\nenhance the energy relaxation rate. We examine the effect of resonant\nrelaxation on the rate of tidal disruption of stars by the central mass; we\nfind that the flux of stars into the loss cone is enhanced when the loss cone\nis empty, but that the disruption rate averaged over the entire cluster is not\nstrongly affected. We show that relativistic precession can disable resonant\nrelaxation near the main-sequence loss cone for black hole masses comparable to\nthose in galactic nuclei. Resonant dynamical friction leads to growth or decay\nof the eccentricity of the orbit of a massive body, depending on whether the\ndistribution function of the stars is predominantly radial or tangential. The\naccelerated relaxation implies that there are regions in nuclear star clusters\nthat are relaxed in angular momentum but not in energy; unfortunately, these\nregions are not well-resolved in nearby galaxies by the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 96"}

{"prompt": "  A new method for measuring the shear induced by gravitational light\ndeflection is proposed. It is based on analyzing the anisotropy induced in the\nauto-correlation function (ACF) of the extragalactic background light which is\nproduced by very faint distant galaxies. The ACF can be measured `locally', and\nits anisotropy is caused by the tidal gravitational field of the deflecting\nmass distribution in the foreground of these faint background galaxies. Since\nthe method does not require individual galaxy detection, it can be used to\nmeasure the shear of extremely faint galaxies which are not detectable\nindividually, but are present in the noise. The shear estimated from the ACF of\nthe noise provides an independent measurement which can be compared to the\nshear obtained from the distortion of individual galaxy images. Combining these\ntwo independent estimates clearly increases the sensitivity of shear\nmeasurements. In addition, our method may allow to determine the local\nmagnification caused by the deflector if the auto-correlation function is\ncaused by a large number density of faint galaxies; in this case, the intrinsic\nACF may provide a `standard source' with respect to which shear and\nmagnification can be obtained. Applications to real and synthetic data are\nshown and the feasibility of our new method is demonstrated.

Both methods are designed to accommodate intrinsic scatter\nin addition to measurement errors.

It\nis quite general, allowing a) for measurement errors on both variables, b) the\nmeasurement errors for the two variables to be dependent, c) the magnitudes of\nthe measurement errors to depend on the measurements, and d) other `symmetric'\nlines such as the bisector and the orthogonal regression can be constructed.\nThe second method is a weighted least squares (WLS) estimator, which applies\nonly in the case where the `independent' variable is measured without error and\nthe magnitudes of the measurement errors on the 'dependent' variable are\nindependent from the measurements. Several applications are made to\nextragalactic astronomy: The BCES method, when applied to data describing the\ncolor-luminosity relations for field galaxies, yields significantly different\nslopes than OLS and other estimators used in the literature.

Unsurprisingly, the least-biased results are obtained when color is\ntreated as the dependent variable. The Tully-Fisher relation is another example\nwhere the BCES method should be used because errors in luminosity and velocity\nare correlated due to inclination corrections. We also find, via simulations,\nthat the WLS method is by far the best method for the Tolman surface-brightness\ntest, producing the smallest variance in slope by an order of magnitude.\nMoreover, with WLS it is not necessary to ``reduce'' galaxies to a fiducial\nsurface-brightness, since this model incorporates intrinsic scatter.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 96"}

The stars\nin our sample are spatially distributed from the cluster center out to 10\narcminutes in radius (4.5 core radii).

Of\nthese six candidates, one was discovered as a binary previously by Pryor et al.\n(1991) and candidate ST is a binary with a very short-period of three to five\ndays. We obtained three possible orbital solutions for binary candidate ST by\nfitting its radial velocity data. These orbital solutions are consistent with\nstar ST being a cluster member, although its spectrum has much stronger MgI\ntriplet absorption line than that of a typical low-metallicity giant star.

Our survey has a\nbinary discovery efficiency of 29% for systems with 3d < P < 10yr, 0.125 < q <\n1.75 and eccentric orbits (0 < e < 1).

Stellar\npopulation synthesis models show that the H beta line is a good age indicator,\nhence disky galaxies tend to have younger mean ages than boxy galaxies. We show\nthat the observed trend can be brought about by a contaminating young\npopulation, which we associate with the disky component. This population need\nonly account for a small fraction of the total mass, for example if a\ncontaminating population of age of 2 Gyrs is superimposed on an old (12 Gyr)\nelliptical galaxy, then the observed trend can be explained if it contributes\nonly 10% to the total mass.

Single-electron tunneling seems to be the most promising\ncandidate to be used in the future integrated digital circuits with the typical\nsize scale of few nanometers and below, i.e. in the molecular electronics. In\nthe review we first briefly discuss the physics of single-electron tunneling\nand the operation of the single-electron transistor. After that, we concentrate\non the hypothetical ultradense digital single-electron circuits and discuss the\ndifferent proposed families of them. The last part of the review considers the\nissues of the discrete energy spectrum and the finite tunnel barrier height\nwhich are important for the molecular-size single-electron devices.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 96"}

However, for homogeneous and isotropic media having\nfinite correlation-lengths, a good degree of correspondence between the two\nsets of local porosity distributions can be obtained by rescaling lengths, and\nthe mapping associating corresponding distributions can be found from\ntwo-dimensional observations alone. The agreement between associated\ndistributions is good as long as the linear extent of the measurement cells\ninvolved is somewhat larger than the correlation length, and it improves as the\nlinear extent increases. A simple application of the central limit theorem\nshows that there must be a correspondence in the limit of very large\nmeasurement cells, because the distributions from both sets approach normal\ndistributions. A normal distribution has two independent parameters: the mean\nand the variance. If the sample is large enough, LPDs from both sets will have\nthe same mean. Therefore corresponding distributions are found by matching\nvariances of two- and three-dimensional local porosity distributions. The\nvariance can be independently determined from correlation functions. Equating\nvariances leads to a scaling relation for lengths in this limit. Three\nparticular systems are examined in order to show that this scaling behavior\npersists at smaller length-scales.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 96"}

{"prompt": "  The cross section for Drell-Yan pair production in the limit of small\n$x$-target is derived in the rest frame of the target hadron. Our calculation\nis based on the fundamental quantity $\\sigma(\\rho)$, the cross section for the\nscattering of a $q\\bar{q}$-pair with fixed transverse separation $\\rho$ off a\nhadronic target. As in deep inelastic scattering the result can be given in\nterms of integrals of $\\sigma(\\rho)$. This is consistent with well known\nfactorization theorems and also relates higher-twist terms in both processes.\nAn analysis of the angular distribution of the produced lepton shows that\nadditional integrals of $\\sigma(\\rho)$ can be obtained in the Drell-Yan\nprocess, which are not measurable in inclusive deep inelastic scattering.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 96"}

{"prompt": "  The phenomenology associated with gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking is\npresented. A renormalization group analysis of the minimal model is performed\nin which the constraints of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking are\nimposed. The resulting superpartner and Higgs boson spectra are highly\ncorrelated and depend on only a few parameters. Superpartner mass ratios and\nsum rules are identified which can be tested at future colliders. Some of these\nrelations are logarithmically sensitive to the messenger scale, while others\nallow gauge-mediation to be distinguished from other schemes for tansmitting\nsupersymmetry breaking. Deviations from the minimal model, such as larger\nmessenger representations and additional contributions to Higgs sector masses,\ncan in some circumstances dramatically modify the low energy spectrum. These\nmodifications include a slepton or Higgsino as the lightest standard model\nsuperpartner, or exotic mass relations among the scalars and gauginos. The\ncontribution to $b \\to s \\gamma$ and resulting bound on superpartner masses are\nalso presented for the minimal model. Finally, the unique collider signatures\nof heavy charged particle production, or decay to the Goldstino within a\ndetector are discussed.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 96"}
{"prompt": "  We study in some detail the spectral phenomenology of models in which\nsupersymmetry is dynamically broken and transmitted to the supersymmetric\npartners of the quarks, leptons and gauge bosons, and the Higgs bosons\nthemselves, via the usual gauge interactions. We elucidate the parameter space\nof what we consider to be the minimal model, and explore the regions which give\nrise to consistent radiative electroweak symmetry breaking. We include the\nweak-scale threshold corrections, and show how they considerably reduce the\nscale dependence of the results. We examine the sensitivity of our results to\nunknown higher-order messenger-sector corrections. We compute the superpartner\nspectrum across the entire parameter space, and compare it to that of the\nminimal supergravity-inspired model. We delineate the regions where the\nlightest neutralino or tau slepton is the next-to-lightest supersymmetric\nparticle, and compute the lifetime and branching ratios of the NLSP. In\ncontrast to the minimal supergravity-inspired model, we find that the lightest\nneutralino can have a large Higgsino component, of order 50%. Nevertheless, the\nneutralino branching fraction to the gravitino and the light Higgs boson\nremains small, < 10^{-4}, so the observation of such a decay would point to a\nnon-minimal Higgs sector.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 96"}
