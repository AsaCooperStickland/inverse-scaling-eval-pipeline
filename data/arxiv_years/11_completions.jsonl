To solve the problem we use the Besancon Galaxy Model\nto provide a scheme for parameter fitting of the structural characteristics of\nthe bulge region. The fitting process allows the determination of the global\nshape of the bulge main structure.\n  We explore various parameters and shape for the bulge/bar structure based on\nFerrer's ellipsoids and fit the shape of the inner disc in the same process.\nThe results show that the main structure is a quite standard triaxial boxy\nbar/bulge with an orientation of about 13 degree with respect to the Sun-centre\ndirection. But the fit is greatly improved when we add a second structure,\nwhich is a longer and thicker ellipsoid. We emphasize that our first ellipsoid\nrepresent the main boxy bar of the Galaxy, and that the thick bulge could be\neither a classical bulge slightly flattened by the effect of the bar potential,\nor a inner thick disc counterpart. We show that the double clump seen at\nintermediate latitudes can be reproduced by adding a slight flare to the bar.\nIn order to better characterize the populations, we further simulate several\nfields which have been surveyed in spectroscopy and for which metallicity\ndistribution function (MDF) are available. The model is in good agreement with\nthese MDF along the minor axis if we assume that the main bar has a mean solar\nmetallicity and the second thicker population has a lower metallicity.

Cyclic field\nvariations, characteristic for the solar magnetic field, are often explained by\nan important omega-effect, i.e. by the stretching of field lines due to strong\ndifferential rotation. Aims: The dynamo mechanism of a convective, oscillatory\ndynamo model is investigated. Methods: We solve the MHD-equations for a\nconducting Boussinesq fluid in a rotating spherical shell. For a resulting\noscillatory model, dynamo coefficients have been computed with the help of the\nso-called test-field method. Subsequently, these coefficients have been used in\na mean-field calculation in order to explore the underlying dynamo mechanism.\nResults: Although the rather strong differential rotation present in this model\ninfluences the magnetic field, the omega-effect alone is not responsible for\nits cyclic time variation. If the omega-effect is suppressed, the resulting\nalpha^2-dynamo remains oscillatory. Surprisingly, the corresponding alpha-omega\ndynamo leads to a non-oscillatory magnetic field.

We find the dust to be moderately heated, typically by 30-100\ntimes the interstellar radiation field. The source of the radiation is likely\nhydrogen recombination, where the excitation of hydrogen occurred in the shock\nfront. The ratio of very small grains to big grains is found for most of the\nmolecular interacting SNRs to be higher than that found in the plane of the\nMilky Way, typically by a factor of 2--3. We suggest that dust shattering is\nresponsible for the relative over-abundance of small grains, in agreement with\nprediction from dust destruction models. However, two of the SNRs are best fit\nwith a very low abundance of carbon grains to silicate grains and with a very\nhigh radiation field.

As one example, consider that only a fraction\nof the neutrinos travel faster than the speed of light, such as sterile\nneutrinos. We fit the OPERA data including this fraction as a free variable,\nassuming that the OPERA result is correct.

Increasing\nthe level of thermal stratification within the layer does not significantly\nalter the critical value of $R_M$ in the rotating calculations, but it does\nlead to a reduction in this critical value in the non-rotating cases. At the\nhighest computationally-accessible values of the magnetic Reynolds number, the\nsaturation levels of the dynamo are similar in all cases, with the mean\nmagnetic energy density somewhere between 4 and 9% of the mean kinetic energy\ndensity. To gain further insights into the differences between rotating and\nnon-rotating convection, we quantify the stretching properties of each flow by\nmeasuring Lyapunov exponents. Away from the boundaries, the rate of stretching\ndue to the flow is much less dependent upon depth in the rotating cases than it\nis in the corresponding non-rotating calculations. It is also shown that the\neffects of rotation significantly reduce the magnetic energy dissipation in the\nlower part of the layer. We also investigate certain aspects of the saturation\nmechanism of the dynamo.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 12"}

Although strong infrared excess\nclearly shows that the central object is surrounded by large amounts of\ncircumstellar material, no information about the spatial distribution of this\ncircumstellar material has been available until now. We used the ESO Very Large\nTelescope Interferometer to perform long-baseline interferometric observations\nof NGC 2264 IRS 1 in the mid-infrared regime. Our observations resolve the\ncircumstellar material around NGC 2264 IRS 1, provide the first direct\nmeasurement of the angular size of the mid-infrared emission, and yield direct\nconstraints on the spatial distribution of the dust. We use different\napproaches (a geometrical model, a temperature-gradient model, and radiative\ntransfer models) to jointly model the observed interferometric visibilities and\nthe spectral energy distribution. The derived visibility values between ~0.02\nand ~0.3 show that the mid-infrared emission is clearly resolved. The\ncharacteristic size of the MIR-emission region is ~30-60 AU; this value is\ntypical for other YSOs with similar or somewhat lower luminosities. A\ncomparison of the sizes for the two position angles shows a significant\nelongation of the dust distribution. Simple spherical envelope models are\ntherefore inconsistent with the data. The radiative transfer modeling of our\ndata suggests that we observe a geometrically thin and optically thick\ncircumstellar disk with a mass of about 0.1 Msun. Our modeling indicates that\nNGC 2264 IRS 1 is surrounded by a flat circumstellar disk that has properties\nsimilar to disks typically found around lower-mass young stellar objects.

However, among\nthe very few prior successive cancellation (SC) polar decoder designs, the\nrequired long code length makes the decoding latency high.

With pipelining and parallel processing\nschemes, a parallel SC polar decoder is proposed. Sub-structure sharing\napproach is employed to design the merged processing element (PE). Moreover,\ninspired by the real FFT architecture, this paper presents a novel input\ngenerating circuit (ICG) block that can generate additional input signals for\nmerged PEs on-the-fly.

{"prompt": "  In this paper we consider a probabilistic signal-to-interference and-noise\nratio (SINR) constrained problem for transmit beamforming design in the\npresence of imperfect channel state information (CSI), under a multiuser\nmultiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink scenario. In particular, we deal\nwith outage-based quality-of-service constraints, where the probability of each\nuser's SINR not satisfying a service requirement must not fall below a given\noutage probability specification. The study of solution approaches to the\nprobabilistic SINR constrained problem is important because CSI errors are\noften present in practical systems and they may cause substantial SINR outages\nif not handled properly. However, a major technical challenge is how to process\nthe probabilistic SINR constraints. To tackle this, we propose a novel\nrelaxation- restriction (RAR) approach, which consists of two key\ningredients-semidefinite relaxation (SDR), and analytic tools for\nconservatively approximating probabilistic constraints. The underlying goal is\nto establish approximate probabilistic SINR constrained formulations in the\nform of convex conic optimization problems, so that they can be readily\nimplemented by available solvers. Using either an intuitive worst-case argument\nor specialized probabilistic results, we develop various conservative\napproximation schemes for processing probabilistic constraints with quadratic\nuncertainties. Consequently, we obtain several RAR alternatives for handling\nthe probabilistic SINR constrained problem. Our techniques apply to both\ncomplex Gaussian CSI errors and i.i.d. bounded CSI errors with unknown\ndistribution. Moreover, results obtained from our extensive simulations show\nthat the proposed RAR methods significantly improve upon existing ones, both in\nterms of solution quality and computational complexity.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 18"}
