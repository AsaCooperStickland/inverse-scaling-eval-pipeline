{"prompt": "  We construct a class of periodic tilings of the plane, which corresponds to\ntoroidal arrangements of trivalent atoms, with pentagonal, hexagonal and\nheptagonal rings. Each tiling is characterized by a set of four integers and\ndetermines a toroidal molecule. The tiling rules are motivated by geometric\nconsiderations and the tiling patterns are rich enough to describe a wide class\nof toroidal carbon molecules, with a broad range of shapes and numbers of\natoms. The molecular dimensions are simply related to the integers that\ndetermine the tiling. The configurational energy and the delocalisation energy\nof several molecules obtained in this way were computed for Tersoff and\nH\\\"uckel models. The results indicate that many of these molecules are not\nstrained, and may be expected to be stable. We studied the influence of size on\nthe H\\\"{u}ckel spectrum: it bears both similarities and differences as compared\nwith the case of tubules.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20mt"}

Theoretical analysis of\nexperimental results is essential in explaining certain surprising observations\nand in providing guidance for optimizing conditions and methods of growth. We\nreview recent theoretical work on the diffusion of adatoms, the structure of\nadsorbate monolayers, and their implications for growth on the Si and Ge (111)\nsurfaces. The theoretical analysis consists of first-principles calculations of\nthe total-energy and entropy factors for stable, metastable and saddle-point\nconfigurations.

Its application to neutral sodium clusters with 8 and 20\natoms shows that the SIC provides sizeable effects in Na_8, leading to a\ndifferent ordering of the low lying isomeric states compared with ab-initio LDA\npredictions, whereas for Na_20, the SIC effects are less pronounced, such that\na quantitative agreement is achieved between the present method and ab-initio\nLDA calculations.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20mt"}

We employ a 3D quantum four-state lattice model\nand mean-field theory.

The melting curve was obtained by computing $% \\Delta H_m$ and\n$\\Delta V_m$ and integrating the Clapeyron equation. Our $% \\Delta H_m$ is in\nagreement with previous estimates and we obtain a reasonable $\\Delta V_m$, but\nour melting slope dT/dP (114 K/GPa) is three times greater than that of Zerr\nand Boehler [1994] (35 K/GPa), suggesting a problem with the experimental\nmelting curve, or an indication of exotic, non-ionic behavior of MgO liquid.

{"prompt": "  We have extended the validity of the correlation between the surface\n3d-core-level shift (SCLS) and the surface d band shift (SDBS) to the entire 4d\ntransition metal series and to the neighboring elements Sr and Ag via accurate\nfirst-principles calculations. We find that the correlation is quasilinear and\nrobust with respect to the differencies both between initial and final-state\ncalculations of the SCLS's and two distinct measures of the SDBS's. We show\nthat despite the complex spatial dependence of the surface potential shift\n(SPS) and the location of the 3d and 4d orbitals in different regions of space,\nthe correlation exists because the sampling of the SPS by the 3d and 4d\norbitals remains similar. We show further that the sign change of the SCLS's\nacross the transition series does indeed arise from the d band-narrowing\nmechanism previously proposed. However, while in the heavier transition metals\nthe predicted increase of d electrons in the surface layer relative to the bulk\narises primarily from transfers from s and p states to d states within the\nsurface layer, in the lighter transition metals the predicted decrease of\nsurface d electrons arises primarily from flow out into the vacuum.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20mt"}

The structural and energetic\nproperties of this new adsorbate phase are analyzed and discussed in view of\nattempts to bridge the so-called \"pressure gap\" in heterogeneous catalysis.

Anharmonic\neffects are treated exactly in the direction normal to the surface, and within\na quasiharmonic approximation in the plane of the surface. We apply this model\nto the Ag(111) and Al(111) surfaces, and find that our calculations reproduce\nthe experimental observation of a large and anomalous increase in the surface\nthermal expansion of Ag(111) at high temperatures [P. Statiris, H.C. Lu and T.\nGustafsson, Phys. Rev. Lett. 72, 3574 (1994)]. Surprisingly, we find that this\nincrease can be attributed to a rapid softening of the in-plane phonon\nfrequencies, rather than due to the anharmonicity of the out-of-plane surface\nphonon modes. This provides evidence for a new mechanism for the enhancement of\nsurface anharmonicity. A comparison with Al(111) shows that the two surfaces\nbehave quite differently, with no evidence for such anomalous behavior on\nAl(111).\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20mt"}
