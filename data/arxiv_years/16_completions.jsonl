When groups of people flee from a danger such as a burning building\nor a terrorist attack, the collective benefit of cooperation is important, but\nthe cost of helping is high and the temptation to defect is strong. To explore\nthe degree of cooperation in emergencies, we develop a new social game, the\nhelp-or-escape social dilemma. Under time and monetary pressure, players decide\nhow much risk they are willing to take in order to help others. Results\nindicated that players took as much risk to help others during emergencies as\nthey did under normal conditions. In both conditions, most players applied an\negalitarian heuristic and helped others until their chance of success equalled\nthat of the group. This strategy is less efficient during emergencies, however,\nbecause the increased time pressure results in fewer people helped.\nFurthermore, emergencies tend to amplify participants initial tendency to\ncooperate, with prosocials becoming even more cooperative and individualists\nbecoming even more selfish. Our framework offers new opportunities to study\nhuman cooperation and could help authorities to better manage crowd behaviours\nduring mass emergencies.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 16"}

The\nessential ingredients used in his work are the topologically twisted N = 4\nYang-Mills theory, localization equations and surface operators. In this paper\nwe extend his construction in two possible ways. On one hand we show that a\nslight modification of Witten's brane construction could lead, using certain\nwell defined duality transformations, to the model used by Ooguri-Vafa to study\nknot invariants using gravity duals. On the other hand, we argue that both\nthese constructions, of Witten and of Ooguri-Vafa, lead to two different\nseven-dimensional manifolds in M-theory from where the topological theories may\nappear from certain twisting of the G-flux action. The non-abelian nature of\nthe topological action may also be studied if we take the wrapped M2-brane\nstates in the theory. We discuss explicit constructions of the\nseven-dimensional manifolds in M-theory, and show that both the localization\nequations and surface operators appear naturally from the Hamiltonian formalism\nof the theories. Knots and link invariants are then constructed using M2-brane\nstates in both the models.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 07"}

{"prompt": "  Unlike spiral galaxies such as the Milky Way, the majority of the stars in\nmassive elliptical galaxies were formed in a short period early in the history\nof the Universe. The duration of this formation period can be measured using\nthe ratio of magnesium to iron abundance ([Mg/Fe]), which reflects the relative\nenrichment by core-collapse and type Ia supernovae. For local galaxies, [Mg/Fe]\nprobes the combined formation history of all stars currently in the galaxy,\nincluding younger and metal-poor stars that were added during late-time\nmergers. Therefore, to directly constrain the initial star-formation period, we\nmust study galaxies at earlier epochs. The most distant galaxy for which\n[Mg/Fe] had previously been measured is at z~1.4, with\n[Mg/Fe]=0.45(+0.05,-0.19). A slightly earlier epoch (z~1.6) was probed by\nstacking the spectra of 24 massive quiescent galaxies, yielding an average\n[Mg/Fe] of 0.31+/-0.12. However, the relatively low S/N of the data and the use\nof index analysis techniques for both studies resulted in measurement errors\nthat are too large to allow us to form strong conclusions. Deeper spectra at\neven earlier epochs in combination with analysis techniques based on full\nspectral fitting are required to precisely measure the abundance pattern\nshortly after the major star-forming phase (z>2). Here we report a measurement\nof [Mg/Fe] for a massive quiescent galaxy at z=2.1.

By adopting the classical\nequilibrium moment or setting the so-called \"magic\" parameter to 1/12, the\nanisotropic term can be eliminated, which is found from the present third-order\nanalysis and also validated numerically. As for the third-order isotropic term,\nwhen and only when it is considered, accurate continuum form pressure tensor\ncan be definitely obtained, by which the predicted coexistence densities always\nagree well with the numerical results. Compared with this continuum form\npressure tensor, the classical discrete form pressure tensor is accurate only\nwhen the isotropic term is a specific one. At last, in the framework of the\npresent third-order analysis, a consistent scheme for third-order additional\nterm is proposed, which can be used to independently adjust the coexistence\ndensities and surface tension. Numerical tests are subsequently carried out to\nvalidate the present scheme.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 21"}

Based on the Queuing theory and birth-death chain theory, we first\ndevelop a general theoretical framework to fully depict the source/relay buffer\noccupancy process in such a MANET, which applies to any distributed MAC\nprotocol and any mobility model that leads to the uniform distribution of\nnodes' locations in steady state. With the help of this framework, we then\nderive the exact expressions of several key network performance metrics,\nincluding achievable throughput, throughput capacity, and expected end-to-end\ndelay. We further conduct case studies under two network scenarios and provide\nthe corresponding theoretical/simulation results to demonstrate the application\nas well as the efficiency of our theoretical framework. Finally, we present\nextensive numerical results to illustrate the impacts of buffer constraint on\nthe performance of a buffer-limited MANET.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 16"}

{"prompt": "  Protoplanetary disks are a byproduct of the star formation process. In the\ndense mid-plane of these disks, planetesimals and planets are expected to form.\nThe first step in planet formation is the growth of dust particles from\nsubmicrometer-sized grains to macroscopic mm-sized aggregates. The grain growth\nis accompanied by radial drift and vertical segregation of the particles within\nthe disk. To understand this essential evolutionary step, spatially resolved\nmulti-wavelength observations as well as photometric data are necessary which\nreflect the properties of both disk and dust. We present the first spatially\nresolved image obtained with NACO at the VLT in the L$_\\text{p}$ band of the\nnear edge-on protoplanetary disk FS Tau B. Based on this new image, a\npreviously published Hubble image in H band and the spectral energy\ndistribution from optical to millimeter wavelengths, we derive constraints on\nthe spatial dust distribution and the progress of grain growth. For this\npurpose we perform a disk modeling using the radiative transfer code MC3D.\nRadial drift and vertical sedimentation of the dust are not considered.

{"prompt": "  In a combinatorial auction with item bidding, agents participate in multiple\nsingle-item second-price auctions at once. As some items might be substitutes,\nagents need to strategize in order to maximize their utilities. A number of\nresults indicate that high welfare can be achieved this way, giving bounds on\nthe welfare at equilibrium. Recently, however, criticism has been raised that\nequilibria are hard to compute and therefore unlikely to be attained.\n  In this paper, we take a different perspective. We study simple best-response\ndynamics. That is, agents are activated one after the other and each activated\nagent updates his strategy myopically to a best response against the other\nagents' current strategies. Often these dynamics may take exponentially long\nbefore they converge or they may not converge at all. However, as we show,\nconvergence is not even necessary for good welfare guarantees. Given that\nagents' bid updates are aggressive enough but not too aggressive, the game will\nremain in states of good welfare after each agent has updated his bid at least\nonce.\n  In more detail, we show that if agents have fractionally subadditive\nvaluations, natural dynamics reach and remain in a state that provides a $1/3$\napproximation to the optimal welfare after each agent has updated his bid at\nleast once. For subadditive valuations, we can guarantee an $\\Omega(1/\\log m)$\napproximation in case of $m$ items that applies after each agent has updated\nhis bid at least once and at any point after that.

Thus, generic initial kinetic densities\nevolve toward the Dirac measure concentrated on the average phase.

The ohmic connection and\nthe short wiring lengths between the chips in the card and the terminal\nconstitute an ideal setting for the KLJN protocol, and even its simplest\nversions offer unprecedented security and privacy for credit/debit card chips\nand applications of physical unclonable functions.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 14"}
{"prompt": "  The two-dimensional organic conductor $\\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ undergoes\na metal-insulator transition at $T_{\\rm CO}=135$ K due to electronic charge\nordering. We have conducted time-resolved investigations of its electronic\nproperties in order to explore the field- and temperature-dependent dynamics.\nAt a certain threshold field, the system switches from low-conducting to a\nhigh-conducting state, accompanied by a negative differential resistance. Our\ntime-dependent infrared investigations indicate that close to $T_{\\rm CO}$ the\nstrong electric field pushes the crystal into a metallic state with optical\nproperties similar to the one for $T>T_{\\rm CO}$. Well into the insulating\nstate, however, at $T=80$ K, the spectral response evidences a completely\ndifferent electronically-induced high-conducting state. Applying a two-state\nmodel of hot electrons explains the observations by excitation of charge\ncarriers with a high mobility. They resemble the Dirac-like charge-carriers\nwith a linear dispersion of the electronic bands found in\n$\\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ at high-pressure. Extensive numerical simulations\nquantitatively reproduce our experimental findings in all details.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 19"}
{"prompt": "  The verification of quantum devices is an important aspect of quantum\ninformation, especially with the emergence of more advanced experimental\nimplementations of computation and secure communication. Within this, the\ntheory of device-independent robust self-testing via Bell tests has reached a\nlevel of maturity now that many quantum states and measurements can be verified\nwithout direct access to the quantum systems: interaction with the devices is\nsolely classical. However, the requirements for this robust level of\nverification are daunting and require high levels of experimental accuracy. In\nthis paper we discuss the possibility of self-testing where we have direct\naccess to part of the quantum device. This motivates the study of self-testing\nvia EPR-steering, an intermediate form of entanglement verification between\nfull state tomography and a Bell test. Quantum non-locality implies\nEPR-steering so results in the former can apply in the latter, but we ask what\nadvantages may be gleaned from the latter over the former given that one can do\npartial state tomography. We show in the case of self-testing a maximally\nentangled two-qubit state, or ebit, EPR-steering allows for simpler analysis\nand better error tolerance than in the case of full device-independence. On the\nother hand, this improvement is only a constant improvement and (up to\nconstants) is the best one can hope for. Finally, we indicate that the main\nadvantage in self-testing based on EPR-steering could be in the case of\nself-testing multi-partite quantum states and measurements. For example, it may\nbe easier to establish a tensor product structure for a particular party's\nHilbert space even if we do not have access to their part of the global quantum\nsystem.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 12"}
{"prompt": "  In this work, we present results from a long-term precipitable water vapor\n(PWV) study in the Chajnantor area, in northern Chile. Data from several\ninstruments located at relevant sites for sub-millimeter and mid-infrared\nastronomy were processed to obtain relations between the atmospheric conditions\namong the sites. The data used for this study can be considered the richest\ndataset to date, because of the geographical sampling of the region, including\nsites at different altitudes, a time span from 2005 to 2014, and the different\ntechniques and instruments used for the measurements. We validate a method to\nconvert atmospheric opacity from 350 $\\mu$m tipper radiometers to PWV. An\naverage of 0.68 PWV ratio between Cerro Chajnantor and Llano of Chajnantor was\nfound.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 15"}
{"prompt": "  We present a method to identify spurious signals generated by finite-width\npulses in quantum sensing experiments and apply it to recently proposed\ndynamical decoupling sequences for accurate spectral interpretation. We first\nstudy the origin of these fake resonances and quantify their behavior in a\nsituation that involves the measurement of a classical magnetic field. Here we\nshow that a change of the initial phase of the sensor or, equivalently, of the\ndecoupling pulses leads to oscillations in the spurious signal intensity while\nthe real resonances remain intact. Finally we extend our results to the quantum\nregime for the unambiguous detection of remote nuclear spins by utilization of\na nitrogen vacancy sensor in diamond.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 11"}
