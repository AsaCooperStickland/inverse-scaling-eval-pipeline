{"prompt": "  The profile of a Bennett hole induced by laser field in ionic distribution in\ncollisional plasma is calculated. Influence of Chandrasekhar's dependence of\ncoefficients of velocity space transport on the profile is included into the\ncalculation for the first time. It is found that the hole narrows down as the\nfield detuning frequency increases. Physical cause of the effect is the falling\ndependence of Coulomb collision frequency on the ionic velocity. Estimations\nshow that the effect is quite observable under conditions of high-current\ngas-discharge plasma.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20pl"}
{"prompt": "  It is planned to use atomic processes to spread out most of the heating power\nover the first wall and side walls to reduce the heat loads on the plasma\nfacing components in ITER to ~ 50 MW. Calculations indicate that there will be\n100 MW in bremstrahlung radiation from the plasma center, 50 MW of radiation\nfrom the plasma edge inside the separatrix and 100 MW of radiation from the\nscrape-off layer and divertor plasma, leaving 50 MW of power to be deposited on\nthe divertor plates. The radiation losses are enhanced by the injection of\nimpurities such as Neon or Argon at acceptably low levels (~0.1 % Argon, etc.)\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20pl"}
{"prompt": "  A phenomenon analogous to the conical refraction well-known in the\ncrystalooptics and crystaloacoustics is considered for the\nmagnetohydrodynamical waves in a collisionless plasma with anisotropic thermal\npressure. Imposing the most general (generalization of Tsiklauri, 1996, Phys.\nPlasmas, 3, 800) condition for the existence of the phenomenon, angle of the\nconical refraction is calculated which appeared to be dependent on the ratio of\nthe Alfven velocity and sound speed measured in the perpendicular direction in\nrespect to the external magnetic field. Feasible ways of experimental\ndemonstration of the phenomenon are discussed and a novelty brought by the\ngeneral consideration is outlined.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20pl"}
