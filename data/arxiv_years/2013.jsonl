{"prompt": "  We have analyzed a broad-band optical and near-infrared spectrum of FU Tau A,\na presumed young brown dwarf in the Taurus star forming region that has\nintrigued both theorists and observers by its over-luminosity in the HR diagram\nwith respect to standard pre-main sequence evolutionary models. The new data,\nobtained with the X-Shooter spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope, include\nan unprecedented wealth of information on stellar parameters and simultaneously\nobserved accretion and outflow indicators for FU Tau A. We present the first\nmeasurements of gravity (log g = 3.5 +- 0.5), radial velocity (RV = 22.5 +- 2.9\nkm/s), rotational velocity (v sin(i) = 20 +- 5 km/s) and lithium equivalent\nwidth (W_Li = 430 +- 20 mAA) for FUTau A. From the rotational velocity and the\npublished period we infer a disk inclination of i ~ 50^deg. The lithium content\nis much lower than theoretically expected for such a young very low mass\nobject, adding another puzzling feature to this object's properties. We\ndetermine the mass accretion rate of FU Tau A from comparison of the\nluminosities of 24 emission lines to empirical calibrations from the literature\nand find a mean of log (dM/dt)_acc [M_sun/yr] = -9.9 +- 0.2. The accretion rate\ndetermined independently from modeling of the excess emission in the Balmer and\nPaschen continua is consistent with this value. The corresponding accretion\nluminosity is too small to make a significant contribution to the bolometric\nluminosity. The existence of an outflow in FU Tau A is demonstrated through the\nfirst detection of forbidden emission lines from which we obtain an estimate\nfor the mass loss rate, log (dM/dt)_out [M_sun/yr] < -10.4. The mass outflow\nand inflow rates can be combined to yield (dM/dt)_out / (dM/dt)_acc ~ 0.3, a\nvalue that is in agreement with jet launching models.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2013"}

We first study the functional properties of this problem and show\nthat the objective is concave in the source and noise densities and convex in\nthe density of the input to the channel.

A well known\nresult in information theory pertains to the linearity of optimal encoding and\ndecoding mappings in the scalar Gaussian source and channel setting, at all\nchannel signal-to-noise ratios (CSNRs). In this paper, we study this result\nmore generally, beyond the Gaussian source and channel, and derive the\nnecessary and sufficient condition for linearity of optimal mappings, given a\nnoise (or source) distribution, and a specified power constraint.

The Turbulent Core\nAccretion model invokes such cores as being in approximate virial equilibrium\nand in approximate pressure equilibrium with their surrounding clump medium.\nTheir internal pressure is provided by a combination of turbulence and magnetic\nfields. Alternatively, the Competitive Accretion model requires strongly\nsub-virial initial conditions that then lead to extensive fragmentation to the\nthermal Jeans scale, with intermediate- and high-mass stars later forming by\ncompetitive Bondi-Hoyle accretion. To test these models, we have identified\nfour prime examples of massive (~100Msun) clumps from mid-infrared extinction\nmapping of infrared dark clouds (IRDCs).

We propose a learning algorithm for this problem based on combining the\nFollow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FPL) prediction method with a novel loss\nestimation procedure called Geometric Resampling (GR). Contrary to previous\nsolutions, the resulting algorithm can be efficiently implemented for any\ndecision set where efficient offline combinatorial optimization is possible at\nall. Assuming that the elements of the decision set can be described with\nd-dimensional binary vectors with at most m non-zero entries, we show that the\nexpected regret of our algorithm after T rounds is O(m sqrt(dT log d)). As a\nside result, we also improve the best known regret bounds for FPL in the full\ninformation setting to O(m^(3/2) sqrt(T log d)), gaining a factor of sqrt(d/m)\nover previous bounds for this algorithm.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2013"}

We\nexplore the full density range from the region of spinodal decomposition to the\nfreezing density, i.e. 0.0321 A^-2 - 0.0658 A^-2. In particular we follow the\ndensity dependence of the excitation spectrum, focusing on the low wave--vector\nbehavior of E(q), the roton dispersion, the strength of single quasi--particle\npeak, Z(q), and the static density response function, chi(q). As the density\nincreases, the dispersion E(q) at low wave--vector changes from a super-linear\n(anomalous dispersion) trend to a sub-linear (normal dispersion) one,\nanticipating the crystallization of the system; at the same time the\nmaxon-roton structure, which is barely visible at low density, becomes well\ndeveloped at high densities and the roton wave vector has a strong density\ndependence.

The resulting criterion has several advantages, including the\navoidance of certain technical difficulties relating to sets of measure zero.\nBy considering the 'reality' not of the wavefunction but of the observable\nproperties of any ontological physical theory a novel characterisation of\nnon-locality and contextuality is found.\n  Secondly, a careful analysis of preparation independence, one of the key\nassumptions of the PBR theorem, leads to an analogy with Bell locality, and\nthence to a proposal to weaken it to an assumption of\n`no-preparation-signalling' in analogy with no-signalling. This amounts to\nintroducing non-local correlations in the joint ontic state, which is, at\nleast, consistent with the Bell and Kochen-Specker theorems.
