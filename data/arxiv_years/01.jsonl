Our best\nunderstanding of the Phillips relation between light curve speed and peak\nluminosity assigns both these phenomena to the amount of $^{56}$Ni produced. In\nELDs there are two sites of $^{56}$Ni synthesis. If the peak luminosity is\ndetermined primarily by the C/O ratio in the core it is primarily a function of\nits progenitor's initial mass. If the light curve decay speed is determined by\nthe total mass of iron group elements ejected this is a function of the total\nmass of the ELD at the time of explosion.

After accounting for observational\nefficiencies and uncertainties (statistical and systematic) we derive the rate\nof type-Ia SNe within the projected central 500 kpc of rich clusters:\nR=0.20(+0.84)(-0.19) SNu in clusters at z=0.18 to 0.37, and\nR=0.41(+1.23)(-0.39) SNu in clusters at z=0.83 to 1.27 (95 per cent confidence\ninterval; H_0=50; 1 SNu = 1 SN per century per 10^10 L_B_sun). Combining the\ntwo redshift bins, the SN rate at a mean redshift of z=0.41 is R(z=0.41) =\n0.30(+0.58)(-0.28) SNu.

All three of\nthese effects and equalities can be traced back to the appearance of a specific\nasymmetry in the otherwise uniform and isotropic electromagnetic quantum\nvacuum. This asymmetry gives rise to a non-zero Poynting vector from the\nperspective of an accelerating object. We call the resulting energy-momentum\nflux the {\\it Rindler flux}. The key insight is that the asymmetry in an\naccelerating reference frame in flat spacetime is identical to that in a\nstationary reference frame (one that is not falling) in curved spacetime.\nTherefore the same Rindler flux that creates inertial reaction forces also\ncreates weight. All of this is consistent with the conceptualizaton and\nformalism of general relativity.

Our evolutionary scheme considers a bimodal star formation (SF),\nincluding long-lived quiescent SF, and enhanced SF taking place during\ntransient events recurrently triggered by interactions and merging. We\ninterpret the strong observed evolution as an increase with z of the rate of\ninteractions between galaxies (density evolution) and an increase of their IR\nluminosity due to the more abundant fuel available in the past (luminosity\nevolution).

{"prompt": "  Surface growth models may give rise to unstable growth with mound formation\nwhose tipical linear size L increases in time. In one dimensional systems\ncoarsening is generally driven by an attractive interaction between domain\nwalls or kinks.

If surface slope increases indefinitely,\nthe deterministic equation looks like a modified Cahn-Hilliard equation: here\nwe study the late stage of coarsening through a linear stability analysis of\nthe stationary periodic configurations and through a direct numerical\nintegration. Analytical and numerical results agree with regard to the\nconclusion that steepening of mounds makes deterministic coarsening faster: if\nalpha is the exponent describing the steepening of the maximal slope M of\nmounds (M^alpha = L) we find that L(t)=t^n: n is equal to 1/4 for 1<alpha<2 and\nit decreases from 1/4 to 1/5 for alpha>2, according to n=alpha/(5*alpha -2). On\nthe other side, the numerical solution of the corresponding stochastic equation\nclearly shows that in the presence of shot noise steepening of mounds makes\ncoarsening slower than in model B: L(t)=t^{1/4}, irrespectively of alpha.\nFinally, the presence of a symmetry breaking term is shown not to modify the\ncoarsening law of model alpha=1, both in the absence and in the presence of\nnoise.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 01\n"}

It is\nfound that, if the initial RW spacetime does not have cosmological horizons,\nthen there is no problem in approaching the fixed point.

Their light curves suggest that the gamma-ray emission\noccurs at early stages of the ejecta expansion, well before it decelerates in\nthe ambient medium. If so, the launched gamma-ray front must overtake the\nejecta and sweep the ambient medium outward. As a result a gap is opened\nbetween the ejecta and the medium that surfs the radiation front ahead.\nEffectively, the ejecta moves in a cavity until it reaches a radius\nR_{gap}=10^{16}E_{54}^{1/2} cm where E is the isotropic energy of the GRB. At\nR=R_{gap} the gap is closed, a blast wave forms and collects the medium swept\nby radiation. Further development of the blast wave is strongly affected by the\nleading radiation front: the front plays the role of a precursor where the\nmedium is loaded with e+- pairs and preaccelerated just ahead of the blast. It\nimpacts the emission from the blast at R < R_{load}=5R_{gap} (the early\nafterglow). A spectacular observational effect results: GRB afterglows should\nstart in optical/UV and evolve fast (< min) to a normal X-ray afterglow. The\nearly optical emission observed in GRB 990123 may be explained in this way. The\nimpact of the front is especially strong if the ambient medium is a wind from a\nmassive progenitor of the GRB.

We extend the minimal model to study different routes to\nfractionalization and deconfinement in the ground state, and also generalize it\nto cases with a uniaxial anisotropy (the spin symmetry group is then U(1)).

The FMM/ICO ratio can be tuned with a\nrelatively small field, which suggests that the internal energy associated with\nthose phases is very similar. Below TN, there is an appreciable FM contribution\nto the magnetization and the ESR spectra indicates the presence of FM clusters\nin an antiferromagnetic matrix (canted).

Numerical results are presented for d-, anisotropic s-, and\nisotropic s-wave superconductors to show explicitly that in unconventional\nsuperconductors the vortex pinning potential is determined mainly by the loss\nof the condensation energy in bulk due to the presence of the pinning center,\ni.e., by the breakdown of the Anderson's theorem. It is found that the vortex\npinning energy in the d-wave pairing case is 4 -- 13 times larger than those in\nthe s-wave pairing cases. This means that an enhancement of pinning effect in\nunconventional superconductors occurs due to the breakdown of the Anderson's\ntheorem.

About 15% of the gas moving at peculiar velocities shows p/k > 10^4\ncm^-3 K, and this fraction drops to 1.5% for quiescent gas. Often, there are\nsmall amounts of gas at p/k > 10^5 cm^-3 K.

Hyperbolic schemes, specifically\nvariations on schemes proposed by Bona and Masso and Anderson and York, are\ncompared with variations of the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formulation.\nModifications of the three basic schemes include raising one index in the\nmetric derivative and extrinsic curvature variables and adding a multiple of\nthe energy constraint to the extrinsic curvature evolution equations. Redundant\nvariables in the Bona-Masso formulation may be reset frequently or allowed to\nevolve freely. Gauge conditions which simplify the dynamical structure of the\nsystem are imposed during each time step, but the lapse and shift are reset\nperiodically to control the evolution of the spacetime slicing and the\nlongitudinal part of the metric. We show that physically correct boundary\nconditions, satisfying the energy and momentum constraint equations,\ngenerically require the presence of some ingoing eigenmodes of the\ncharacteristic matrix. Numerical methods are developed for the hyperbolic\nsystems based on decomposing flux differences into linear combinations of\neigenvectors of the characteristic matrix.

The observation of an IST very close to the quantum\nresistance for pairs, $R_{\\Box}^N \\sim h/4e^2$ on several substrates supports\nthis idea. The relevant length scales here are the localization length, and the\ncoherence length. However, at the transition, the localization length is much\nhigher than the superconducting coherence length, contrary to expectation for a\n\"homogeneous\" transition. This suggests the invalidity of a purely fermionic\nmodel for the transition. Furthermore, the current-voltage characteristics of\nthe superconducting films are hysteretic, and show the films to be granular.\nThe relevant energy scales here are the Josephson coupling energy and the\ncharging energy.

On the other hand, accretion\nlevels dm/dt << 1 are enough to energize the BL Lacs; here the radiation is\nhighly non-thermal and the power partly contributed by the rotational energy of\nthe central Kerr hole, with the latter and the disk together sustaining L ~\n10^44 erg/s in the jet frame for several Gyrs. If so, we expect the BL Lacs to\nshow quite different evolutionary signatures from the FSRQs, and in particular,\nnumber counts close to the Euclidean shape, or flatter if the sources make a\ntransition to the BL Lac from a FSRQ mode.

This is consistent with dust-reddened quasars being more common in\nradio-selected samples than in optically-selected samples, due to stronger\nselection effects against dust-reddened quasars in the latter. We also find a\nstatistically significant dearth of optically luminous quasars with large\nnear-infrared-to-optical luminosity ratios. This can be explained in a dust\nobscuration model but not in a model where synchrotron emission extends from\nthe radio into the near-infrared and creates such large ratios. We also find\nthat selection of quasar candidates from the B-J/J-K color-color diagram,\nmodelled on the V-J/J-K selection method of Warren, Hewett & Foltz (2000), is\nlikely to be more sensitive to dust-obscured quasars than selection using only\ninfrared-infrared colors.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 01\n"}
{"prompt": "  The behaviors of quantum stress tensor for the scalar field on the classical\nbackground of spherical dust collapse is studied. In the previous works\ndiverging flux of quantum radiation was predicted. We use the exact expressions\nin a 2D model formulated by Barve et al. Our present results show that the back\nreaction does not become important during the semiclassical phase. The\nappearance of the naked singularity would not be affected by this quantum field\nradiation. To predict whether the naked singularity explosion occurs or not we\nneed the theory of quantum gravity. We depict the generation of the diverging\nflux inside the collapsing star. The quantum energy is gathered around the\ncenter positively. This would be converted to the diverging flux along the\nCauchy horizon. The ingoing negative flux crosses the Cauchy horizon. The\nintensity of it is divergent only at the central naked singularity. This\ndiverging negative ingoing flux is balanced with the outgoing positive\ndiverging flux which propagates along the Cauchy horizon. After the replacement\nof the naked singularity to the practical high density region the instantaneous\ndiverging radiation would change to more milder one with finite duration.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 01\n"}

An energy window encompassing N bands\nof interest is specified by the user, and the algorithm then proceeds to\ndisentangle these from the remaining bands inside the window by filtering out\nan optimally connected N-dimensional subspace.

{"prompt": "  A simple, non-disordered spin model has been studied in an effort to\nunderstand the origin of the precipitous slowing down of dynamics observed in\nsupercooled liquids approaching the glass transition. A combination of Monte\nCarlo simulations and exact calculations indicates that this model exhibits an\nentropy vanishing transition accompanied by a rapid divergence of time scales.\nMeasurements of various correlation functions show that the system displays a\nhierarchy of time scales associated with different degrees of freedom. Extended\nstructures, arising from the frustration in the system, are identified as the\nsource of the slow dynamics. In the simulations, the system falls out of\nequilibrium at a temperature $T_{g}$ higher than the entropy-vanishing\ntransition temperature and the dynamics below $T_{g}$ exhibits aging as\ndistinct from coarsening. The cooling rate dependence of the energy is also\nconsistent with the usual glass formation scenario.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 01\n"}

{"prompt": "  We have carried out a timing analysis of Cyg X-1 and GRS 1915+105 using more\nthan 5 years worth of data from the All Sky Monitor (ASM) on board RXTE. We\nhave obtained for the first time power density spectra, colour-colour and\ncolour-intensity plots, cross-correlation functions and phase-lag diagrams to\ninvestigate the variability of the sources at frequencies < 10^{-5} Hz. We find\nthat the PDS are not flat but consistent with a power-law of index ~-1. This is\nthe same slope as that found in the power spectra of Cyg X-1 during the soft\nstate. In fact, the power spectrum of Cyg X-1 in the frequency range\n10^{-7}-10^{-5} Hz appears as a continuation of the 10^{-3}-10 Hz power\nspectrum during the soft state. Significant variability, expressed as the\nfractional rms in the frequency range 2 x 10^{-7}-1 x 10^{-5} Hz, is detected\nat a level of 27% and 21% for GRS 1915+105 and Cyg X-1, respectively. Our\nresults confirm previous suggestions that the innermost regions of the\naccretion disc are affected by variations occurring at larger radii from the\nblack hole, presumably due to changes in the mass accretion rate. We also\nobserve strong spectral changes: in Cyg X--1 the spectrum softens as the flux\nincreases when it is in the low/hard state, and hardens with increasing flux in\nthe high/soft state. GRS 1915+105 follows the same trend as Cyg X-1 in the soft\nstate, but the hardness ratios show a larger amplitude of variation. The\ncross-correlation shows that the variations occur simultaneously in all energy\nbands. However, the cross-correlation functions are asymmetric toward negative\nlags. The phase spectrum also reveals negative lags at periods larger than a\nfew days, suggesting that the long term variations in the soft energy band are\ndelayed with respect to the harder bands.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 01\n"}
