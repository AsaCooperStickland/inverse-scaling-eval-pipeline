{"prompt": "  We show that in the dissipative quantum model of brain the time-dependence of\nthe frequencies of the electrical dipole wave quanta leads to the dynamical\norganization of the memories in space (i.e. to their localization in more or\nless diffused regions of the brain) and in time (i.e. to their longer or\nshorter life-time). The life-time and the localization in domains of the memory\nstates also depend on internal parameters and on the number of links that the\nbrain establishes with the external world. These results agree with the\nphysiological observations of the dynamic formation of neural circuitry which\ngrows as brain develops and relates to external world.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20qu"}
{"prompt": "  On December 14. 1900, Max Planck communicated his derivation of his radiation\nformula, which he later called ``an act of desperation''. This date is widely\nrecognized as birthday of quantum theory. For Planck it meant the end of his\ncarefully planned and ambitious research project, in which he wanted to\nestablish the second law of thermodynamics as strictly deterministic law for\nsystems of matter and electromagnetic radiation in interaction. He knew he\ncould not succeed within classical mechanics, but had the somewhat strange hope\nthat the inclusion of Maxwell's electrodynamics would change the situation.\nLater he always disagreed with Einstein's light-quantum hypothesis, because it\nimplied a renunciation from Maxwell's theory, which in Germany gained full\nrecognition and acceptance as late as the 1890's, mainly through the\ntheoretical and experimental work of Heinrich Hertz.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20qu"}
{"prompt": "  A set of quantum states can be unambiguously discriminated if and only if\nthey are linearly independent. However, for a linearly dependent set, if C\ncopies of the state are available, then the resulting C particle states may\nform a linearly independent set, and be amenable to unambiguous discrimination.\nWe obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the possibility of\nunambiguous discrimination between N states given that C copies are available\nand that the single copies span a D dimensional space. These conditions are\nfound to be identical for qubits. We then examine in detail the linearly\ndependent trine ensemble. The set of C>1 copies of each state is a set of\nlinearly independent lifted trine states. The maximum unambiguous\ndiscrimination probability is evaluated for all C>1 with equal a priori\nprobabilities.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20qu"}

One can implement a\nuniversal set of quantum gates on a one-dimensional array purely via signals\nthat target the entire structure indiscriminately. But large-scale quantum\ncomputation imposes several requirements in terms of noise level, time, space\n(scaling) and in particular parallelism. Keeping in mind these requirements, we\nprove GC can support error-correction, by implementing two simple codes.

For the particular case of a free particle moving with a fixed\nvalue of the angular momentum equal to two it is shown that Barut-Giriardello\ncoherent states are more localized at the initial time moment while the\nPerelomov coherent states are more stable with respect to time evolution.

For zero temperature, the time dependent\nconcurrence is studied analytically and numerically for some typical initial\nstates, including a separable (unentangled) initial state. An analytical\nformula for non-zero steady state concurrence is found for any initial state,\nand optimal parameter values for maximizing steady state concurrence are given.\nThe steady state concurrence is found analytically to remain non-zero for low,\nfinite temperatures.
