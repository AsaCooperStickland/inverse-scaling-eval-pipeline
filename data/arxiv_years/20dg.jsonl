{"prompt": "  We construct the first examples of continuous families of isospectral\nRiemannian metrics that are not locally isometric on closed manifolds, more\nprecisely, on $S^n\\times T^m$, where $T^m$ is a torus of dimension $m\\ge 2$ and\n$S^n$ is a sphere of dimension $n\\ge 4$. These metrics are not locally\nhomogeneous; in particular, the scalar curvature of each metric is nonconstant.\nFor some of the deformations, the maximum scalar curvature changes during the\ndeformation.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20dg"}
{"prompt": "  The most important examples of a double vector bundle are provided by\niterated tangent and cotangent functors: TTM, TT^*M, T^*TM, and T^*T^*M. We\nintroduce the notions of the dual double vector bundle and the dual double\nvector bundle morphism. Theorems on canonical isomorphisms are formulated and\nproved.

{"prompt": "  Mutation is an operation on 3-manifolds containing an embedded surface of\ngenus 2. It is defined by cutting along the surface and regluing using the\n`hyperelliptic' involution, and is known to preserve many 3-manifold\ninvariants. I show that mutation of a homology 3-sphere preserves its\n(instanton) Floer homology, and that a related operation on 4-manifolds\npreserves the Donaldson invariants. A companion article (in preparation) will\ntreat invariants based on the Seiberg-Witten equations.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20dg"}
{"prompt": "  This paper presents results on the extent to which mean curvature data can be\nused to determine a surface in space or its shape. The emphasis is on Bonnet's\nproblem: classify and study the surface immersions in $\\R^3$ whose shape is not\nuniquely determined by the first fundamental form and the mean curvature\nfunction. The properties of immersions with umbilics and global rigidity\nresults for closed surfaces are presented in the first part of this paper. The\nsecond part of the paper outlines an existence theory for conformal immersions\nbased on Dirac spinors along with its immediate applications to Bonnet's\nproblem. The presented existence paradigm provides insight into the topology of\nthe moduli space of Bonnet immersions of a closed surface, and reveals a\nparallel between Bonnet's problem and Pauli's exclusion principle.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20dg"}
{"prompt": "  We characterize the harmonic forms on a flag manifold $K/T$ defined by\nKostant in 1963 in terms of a Poisson structure. Namely, they are ``Poisson\nharmonic\" with respect to the so-called Bruhat Poisson structure on $K/T$. This\nenables us to give Poisson geometrical proofs of many of the special properties\nof these harmonic forms. In particular, we construct explicit representatives\nfor the Schubert basis of the $S^1$-equivariant cohomology of $K/T$, where the\n$S^1$-action is defined by $\\rho$. Using a simple argument in equivariant\ncohomology, we recover the connection between the Kostant harmonic forms and\nthe Schubert calculus on $K/T$ that was found by Kostant and Kumar in 1986. We\nalso show that the Kostant harmonic forms are limits of the more familiar Hodge\nharmonic forms with respect to a family of Hermitian metrics.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20dg"}
{"prompt": "  Consider a lattice $\\Gamma$ in a group $G = SL_2(\\R), SO(1,n), SU(1,n)$,\n$SL_2(\\Q_p)$. We discuss actions of $\\Gamma$ by affine isometric\ntransformations of Hilbert spaces. We show that for irreducible affine\nisometric action of $G$ its restriction to $\\Gamma$ is irreducible. We prove\nthe existence of canonical irreducible affine isometric actions of $\\Gamma$\nassociated to actions of $\\Gamma$ on $\\R$- trees. Using such actions we\nconstruct irreducible representations of semigroup of probabilistic measures on\n$\\Gamma$ and construct the series of representations of the groups of\ndiffeomorphisms of Riemann surfaces enumerated by the points of Thurston\ncompactification of Teichm\\\"uller (Teichmuller) space.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20dg"}
