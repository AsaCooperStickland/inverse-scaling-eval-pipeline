{"prompt": "  We present a new method for obtaining matched solutions of the rms envelope\nequations. In this approach, the envelope equations are first expressed in\nHamiltonian form. The Hamiltonian defines a nonlinear mapping, $\\cal M$, and\nfor periodic transport systems the fixed points of the one-period map are the\nmatched envelopes. Expanding the Hamiltonian around a fiducial trajectory one\nobtains a linear map, $M$, that describes trajectories (rms envelopes) near the\nfiducial trajectory. Using $\\cal M$ and $M$ we construct a contraction mapping\nthat can be used to obtain the matched envelopes. The algorithm is\nquadratically convergent. Using the zero-current matched parameters as starting\nvalues, the contraction mapping typically converges in a few to several\niterations. Since our approach uses numerical integration to obtain all the\nmappings, it includes the effects of nonidealized, $z$-dependent transverse and\nlongitudinal focusing fields.

The\nrobustness of this result to changes in the shape of the primary continuum, the\nassumed density and optical depth is investigated. Given the constraints on the\nlocation and the stability properties of the material, several models for the\nenvironments of Seyfert nuclei are discussed. These attempt to explain the\npresence of significant amounts of partially ionized material. In particular,\nvarious models of the broad-line region are discussed. The simple two-phase\nmodel of the broad-line region proves to be unsatisfactory. A model of the\nbroad-line region is presented in which a turbulent, hot intercloud medium is\nmechanically heated. Turbulent mixing layers could then give rise to warm\nabsorption features. Finally, a model is discussed in which the warm absorber\nis due to a steady state, radiatively driven outflow.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 95"}

The\nsubsequent growth of the surface magnetic field occurs owing to ohmic diffusion\nof a strong internal field (10^12-10^13 G) and proceeds over a time scale of\n10^2-10^3 yrs, depending on the early thermal history of the NS, the initial\ndistribution of magnetic flux and the electrical resistivity in the stellar\ncrust, as well as on the details of the stellar structure. Referring to this\nsuggestion, we perform numerical computations to demonstrate its possible\nrelevance to young radio pulsars. In our calculations, we use different NS\nstructures based on a model of dense matter presenting a phase transition to\nkaon condensation which implies both slow and fast neutrino cooling, depending\non the stellar mass.

The velocity is chosen by minimizing some measure\n($\\chi^2$) of the residual intrinsic variability. In many cases this gives a\nclose approximation to the true magnification. In cases where the relative\nmotion of the lensing point masses is important, only a partial separation will\nbe possible.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 95"}

{"prompt": "  Using a new numerical code we have carried out two-dimensional simulations of\nthe nonlinear evolution of unstable sheared magnetohydrodynamic flows. We\nconsidered two cases: a strong magnetic field (Alfven Mach number, M_a = 2.5)\nand a weak field (M_a =5). Each flow rapidly evolves until it reaches a nearly\nsteady condition, which is fundamentally different from the analogous\ngasdynamic state. Both MHD flows relax to a stable, laminar flow on timescales\nless than or of the order of 15 linear growth times, measured from saturation\nof the instability. That timescale is several orders of magnitude less than the\nnominal dissipation time for these simulated flows, so this condition\nrepresents an quasi-steady relaxed state. The strong magnetic field case\nreaches saturation as magnetic tension in the displaced flow boundary becomes\nsufficient to stabilize it. That flow then relaxes in a straightforward way to\nthe steady, laminar flow condition. The weak magnetic field case, on the other\nhand, begins development of the vortex expected for gasdynamics, but that\nvortex is destroyed by magnetic stresses that locally become strong. Magnetic\ntopologies lead to reconnection and dynamical alignment between magnetic and\nvelocity fields. Together these processes produce a sequence of intermittent\nvortices and subsequent relaxation to a nearly laminar flow condition in which\nthe magnetic cross helicity is nearly maximized.

The system KEMDT\n(Korean/English Memory-based Dialog Translation system) can perform Korean to\nEnglish, and English to Korean translation using unified memory network and\nextended marker passing algorithm. We resolve the word order variation and\nfrequent word omission problems in Korean by classifying the concept sequence\nelement in four different types and extending the marker-\npassing-based-translation algorithm. Unlike the previous memory-based\ntranslation systems, the KEMDT system develops the bilingual memory network and\nthe unified bi-directional marker passing translation algorithm.

{"prompt": "  We reanalyse the time evolution of the $K^0-\\bar{K^0}$ system in the language\nof certain spectral function whose Fourier transforms give the time dependent\nsurvival and transition amplitudes.

The main reason for this unexpected behaviour\nis the non-orthogonality of $\\ks$ and $\\kl$. As a result of this theorem new\ncontributions to the well known oscillatory terms will enter the time dependent\ntransition probabilities. These new terms are not associated with small/large\ntime behaviour of the amplitudes and therefore their magnitude is apriori\nunknown. Approximating the spectral functions by an one-pole ansatz Khalfin\nestimated the new effect in transition probabilities to be $4 \\times 10^{-4}$.\nWhereas we agree with Khalfin on the general existence of vacuum regeneration\nof $K_S$ and $K_L$ we disagree on the size of the effect. A careful analysis of\nthe one-pole approximation reveals that the effect is eleven orders of\nmagnitude smaller than Khalfin's estimate and, in principle, its exact\ndetermination lies outside the scope of the one-pole ansatz.

In particular, the induced mass squared must be negative. The\nresulting baryon to entropy ratio is very insensitive to the details of the\ncouplings and initial conditions, but depends on the dimension of the\nnonrenormalizable operator in the superpotential which stabilizes the flat\ndirection and the reheat temperature after inflation. Unlike the original\nscenario, an acceptable baryon asymmetry can result without subsequent entropy\nreleases. In the simplest scenario the baryon asymmetry is generated along the\n$LH_u$ flat direction, and is related to the mass of the lightest neutrino.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 95"}

However, for $N_f \\geq N_c$, we find new exotic\nstates---new vacua with spontaneously broken baryon number for $N_f = N_c$, and\na vacuum state with unbroken chiral symmetry for $N_f > N_c$. These exotic\nvacua contain massless composite fermions and, in some cases, dynamically\ngenerated gauge bosons. In particular Seiberg's electric-magnetic duality seems\nto persist also in the presence of (small) soft supersymmetry breaking. We\nargue that certain, specially tailored, lattice simulations may be able to\ndetect the novel phenomena. Most of the exotic behavior does not survive the\ndecoupling limit of large SUSY breaking parameters.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 95"}
