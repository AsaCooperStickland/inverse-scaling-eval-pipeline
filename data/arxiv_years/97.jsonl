However, certain CAs\nbased on an Abelian group, such as addition mod 2, are termed ``linear''\nbecause they obey a principle of superposition. This allows them to be\npredicted efficiently, in serial time O(t) or O(log t) in parallel.\n  In this paper, we generalize this by looking at CAs with a variety of\nalgebraic structures, including quasigroups, non-Abelian groups, Steiner\nsystems, and others. We show that in many cases, an efficient algorithm exists\neven though these CAs are not linear in the previous sense; we term them\n``quasilinear.''

Our value of Dmu(FV) is in fair\nagreement with the one derived using planetary nebulae and SNe-Ia, while is in\nopen contrast with that coming from surface brightness fluctuations, globular\nclusters luminosity function, and infrared Tully-Fisher relation. In our data\nComa appears slightly nearer than indicated by the other distance indicators,\nbut now a better agreement with the Tully-Fisher relation seems to exist.\nFinally we found that there aren't correlations of the residuals of the\nDn-sigma with the effective surface brightness, the total luminosity of the\ngalaxies, with the ellipticity and the shape parameter a4. Instead a\ncorrelation seems to exists with maximum Vrot, with (V/sigma) and with the\nexponent m of the r^1/m fit to major axis light of galaxies.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 97"}

Determining the time\nconstants of the stretched exponential slopes of the average peak-aligned time\nprofile of GRBs as a function of the peak brightness, we find that the\npost-peak slope shows time dilation when comparing bright and dim bursts, while\nthe pre-peak slope hardly changes. Stronger bursts are thus more symmetric than\nweaker bursts at a high confidence level. The very weakest bursts have a\ndifferent shape (i.e., a different stretched exponential index) of their\naverage time profile as compared to brighter bursts. This difference is too\nlarge to be explained by trigger effects and Poisson noise. We interpret these\ncorrelations as being the result of an intrinsic positive correlation between\nbrightness and complexity of GRBs.

We show that it is necessary to use the\ncorrect relativistic differential scattering cross section in order to obtain a\nphoton kinetic equation that is correct to first order in epsilon/m_e, T_e/m_e,\nand V, where epsilon is the photon energy, T_e and m_e are the electron\ntemperature and rest mass, and V is the electron bulk velocity in units of the\nspeed of light. We also demonstrate that the terms in the radiative transfer\nequation that are second-order in V usually should be retained, because if the\nradiation energy density is sufficiently large compared to the radiation flux,\nthe effects of bulk Comptonization described by the terms that are second-order\nin V are at least as important as the effects described by the terms that are\nfirst-order in V, even when V is small. Our equations are valid for systems of\narbitrary optical depth and can therefore be used in both the free-streaming\nand the diffusion regimes. We demonstrate that Comptonization by the electron\nbulk motion occurs whether or not the radiation field is isotropic or the bulk\nflow converges and that it is more important than thermal Comptonization if V^2\n> 3 T_e/m_e.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 97"}

From simulations this approach\nis found to be reliable as long as the galaxies including their dark matter\nhaloes only contribute a small fraction to the total mass of the system.

The models are able to account for the entire background\nlight recorded in the galaxy counts down to the very faint magnitude levels\nprobed by the HDF. Since only 20% of the current stellar content of galaxies is\nproduced at z>2, a rather low cosmic metallicity is expected at these early\ntimes, in good agreement with the observed enrichment history of the damped\nLyman-\\alpha systems. A ``monolithic collapse'' model, where half of the\npresent-day stars formed at z>2.5 and were shrouded by dust, can be made\nconsistent with the global history of light, but overpredicts the metal mass\ndensity at high redshifts as sampled by QSO absorbers.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 97"}

{"prompt": "  We present a method for determining the rms mass fluctuations on 8 h^-1 Mpc\nscale, sigma8. The method utilizes the rate of evolution of the abundance of\nrich clusters of galaxies. Using the Press-Schechter approximation, we show\nthat the cluster abundance evolution is a strong function of sigma8: d log n/dz\n~ -1/sigma8^2; low sigma8 models evolve exponentially faster than high sigma8\nmodels, for a given mass cluster. For example, the number density of Coma-like\nclusters decreases by a factor of ~10^3$ from z = 0 to z ~ 0.5 for sigma8=0.5\nmodels, while the decrease is only a factor of ~5 for sigma8 ~ 1. The strong\nexponential dependence on sigma8 arises because clusters represent rarer\ndensity peaks in low sigma8 models. We show that the evolution rate at z < 1 is\ninsensitive to the density parameter $\\Omega$ or to the exact shape of the\npower spectrum. Cluster evolution therefore provides a powerful constraint on\nsigma8. Using available cluster data to z ~ 0.8, we find sigma8 = 0.83 +/-\n0.15. This amplitude implies a bias parameter b ~ 1/sigma8 = 1.2 +/- 0.2, i.e.,\na nearly unbiased universe with mass approximately tracing light on large\nscales.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 97"}

This is in agreement with the observed changes of slope in the\nwide-band spectrum: a first change of slope at ~ 10 keV, and a second one at ~\n35 keV. To mimic this behaviour we used a double power law modified by an\nexponential cutoff --- the so-called NPEX model --- to fit the whole 2-100 keV\ncontinuum. This functional is able to adequately describe the data, expecially\nthe low intensity state.

In the absence of\na strong UV flux, the gas is predominantly neutral and may form clouds with HI\ncolumn density NHI > 10^18 cm^-2. Due to their high densities and high HI\ncolumn densities, these clouds are not destroyed by the onset of the UV\nbackground at a later time. Thus, if not disrupted by other processes, such as\nmergers into larger systems or `blow away' by supernovae, they will produce\nLLS. We show that the observed number density of LLS at high redshifts can well\nbe reproduced by the survived `minihalos' in hierarchical clustering models\nsuch as the standard cold dark matter model. The number density of LLS in such\na population increases with z even beyond the redshifts accessible to current\nobservations and dies off quickly at z < 2. This population is distinct from\nother populations because the absorbing systems have small velocity widths and\na close to primordial chemical composition.

For mesoscopic systems the conduction\nprocess is dominated by diffusion but we show that, due to the lack of\ntime-reversal symmetry, the boundary condition for diffusion is altered at the\nreflecting edges. Instead of the usual condition, that the derivative along the\ndirection normal to the wall of the diffusing variable vanishes, the derivative\nat the Hall angle to the normal vanishes. We demonstrate the origin of this\nboundary condition from different starting points, using (i) a simplified\nChalker-Coddington network model, (ii) the standard diagrammatic perturbation\nexpansion, and (iii) the nonlinear sigma-model with the topological term, thus\nestablishing connections between the different approaches.

Strong\ncorrelation effects pin the Fermi level close to, but not precisely at the Van\nHove singularity (VHS), which can enhance the tendency to phase separation. The\nresulting dispersions have been calculated, both in the uniform phases and in\nthe phase separated regime. In the latter case, distinctly different\ndispersions are found for large, random domains and for regular (static)\nstriped arrays, and a hypothetical form is presented for dynamic striped\narrays. The doping dependence of the latter is found to provide an excellent\ndescription of photoemission and thermodynamic experiments on pseudogap\nformation in underdoped cuprates.

The transition is characterized by the loss of Ising and XY order\nat the same point. This analysis suggests that the 2D $J_1-J_2$ XY model is in\nthe same universality class than XY-Ising models.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 97"}

Moreover, they show\nsome remarkable similarity to dark solitons of the Nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nequation. Numerical simulations for the discrete Heisenberg chain show that\nthese solitary waves are highly, but not absolutely stable under interaction\nwith linear excitations and as well under scattering with each other.

{"prompt": "  Previous approaches of analyzing spontaneously spoken language often have\nbeen based on encoding syntactic and semantic knowledge manually and\nsymbolically. While there has been some progress using statistical or\nconnectionist language models, many current spoken- language systems still use\na relatively brittle, hand-coded symbolic grammar or symbolic semantic\ncomponent. In contrast, we describe a so-called screening approach for learning\nrobust processing of spontaneously spoken language. A screening approach is a\nflat analysis which uses shallow sequences of category representations for\nanalyzing an utterance at various syntactic, semantic and dialog levels. Rather\nthan using a deeply structured symbolic analysis, we use a flat connectionist\nanalysis. This screening approach aims at supporting speech and language\nprocessing by using (1) data-driven learning and (2) robustness of\nconnectionist networks. In order to test this approach, we have developed the\nSCREEN system which is based on this new robust, learned and flat analysis. In\nthis paper, we focus on a detailed description of SCREEN's architecture, the\nflat syntactic and semantic analysis, the interaction with a speech recognizer,\nand a detailed evaluation analysis of the robustness under the influence of\nnoisy or incomplete input. The main result of this paper is that flat\nrepresentations allow more robust processing of spontaneous spoken language\nthan deeply structured representations.

In particular, team members often encounter\ndiffering, incomplete, and possibly inconsistent views of their environment.\nFurthermore, team members can unexpectedly fail in fulfilling responsibilities\nor discover unexpected opportunities. Highly flexible coordination and\ncommunication is key in addressing such uncertainties. Simply fitting\nindividual agents with precomputed coordination plans will not do, for their\ninflexibility can cause severe failures in teamwork, and their\ndomain-specificity hinders reusability.

Agents exploit such models to autonomously reason about coordination\nand communication, providing requisite flexibility. Furthermore, the models\nenable reuse across domains, both saving implementation effort and enforcing\nconsistency. This article presents one general, implemented model of teamwork,\ncalled STEAM.
