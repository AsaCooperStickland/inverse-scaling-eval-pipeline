{"prompt": "  We study fractional variability as a function of energy from black-hole X-ray\nbinaries on timescales from milliseconds to hundreds of seconds. We build a\ntheoretical model of energy-dependent variability in which the X-ray energy\nspectrum varies in response to a changing physical parameter. We compare these\nmodels to rms spectra obtained from RXTE PCA observations of black-hole\nbinaries XTE J1550-564 and XTE J1650-500. We show that two main variability\nmodels are consistent with the data: variable seed photon input in the hard\nstate and variable power in the Comptonized component in the soft and very high\nstates. The lack of clear reflection features in the rms spectra implies that\nthe reflection and the X-ray continuum, when integrated over Fourier\nfrequencies, are correlated and vary with similar fractional amplitudes. Our\nmodels predict two important features of rms spectra, not possible to be\nclearly seen by the PCA due sensitivity limits. At soft X-rays, >~3 keV, we\npredict the presence of a break in the rms spectrum at energy directly related\nto the seed photon temperature. At higher energies, ~20--30 keV, we predict a\npeak in the rms spectrum originating from the variability of the spectrum\nproduced by a hybrid thermal/non-thermal electron distribution. If these\nfeatures are confirmed by broad-band observations, they will impose important\nconstraints on the origin of the seed photons for Comptonization and the\nelectron distribution in the hot plasma.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 05\n"}

In this way, the consistency of the routing\nprotocol relies on the coherent sharing of the addressing space among all nodes\nin the network. Such proposals use a logical tree-like structure where routes\nin this space correspond to routes in the physical level.

The more distant\nof these resonances, such as the 9:4, 7:3, 5:2, and the 3:1, can also capture\nparticles in stable, eccentric orbits beyond 50 AU, in the region of phase\nspace conventionally known as the Scattered Disk. Indeed, 90% of the simulated\nparticles that persist over the age of the Solar System in the so-called\nScattered Disk zone never had a close encounter with Neptune, but instead were\npromoted into these eccentric orbits by Neptune's resonances during the\nmigration epoch. This indicates that the observed Scattered Disk might not be\nso scattered. This model also produced only a handful of Centaurs, all of which\noriginated at Neptune's mean motion resonances in the Kuiper Belt. We also\nreport estimates of the abundances and masses of the Belt's various\nsubpopulations (e.g., the resonant KBOs, the Main Belt, and the so-called\nScattered Disk), and also provide upper limits on the abundance of Centaurs and\nNeptune's Trojans, as well as upper limits on the sizes and abundances of\nhypothetical KBOs that might inhabit the a>50 AU zone.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 05\n"}

First, we derive a limit on the typical\nbeaming of GRBs; we find f_b^{-1} >~ 60, ~5 times higher than our earlier\nresults. Second, we impose an upper limit on the rate of events that eject >~\n10^{51} erg in unconfined relativistic ejecta, whether or not accompanied by\ndetectable emission in wavebands other than the radio.

Previous work has shown that both quasars are at z=1.465\nand show broad absorption lines. No evidence for a lensing galaxy has been\nfound between the quasars, but there were two hints of a foreground cluster:\ndiffuse X-ray emission observed with Chandra, and an excess of faint galaxies\nobserved with the Hubble Space Telescope.

We\nestimate the chance of finding a random velocity structure of such significance\nto be about 5%, and thereby interpret the diffuse X-ray emission as originating\nfrom z=0.77, rather than the quasar redshift. The mass of the cluster, as\nestimated from either the velocity dispersion of the z=0.77 galaxies or the\nX-ray luminosity of the diffuse emission, would be consistent with the\ntheoretical mass required for gravitational lensing.

{"prompt": "  The emergence of mental states from neural states by partitioning the neural\nphase space is analyzed in terms of symbolic dynamics. Well-defined mental\nstates provide contexts inducing a criterion of structural stability for the\nneurodynamics that can be implemented by particular partitions. This leads to\ndistinguished subshifts of finite type that are either cyclic or irreducible.\nCyclic shifts correspond to asymptotically stable fixed points or limit tori\nwhereas irreducible shifts are obtained from generating partitions of mixing\nhyperbolic systems. These stability criteria are applied to the discussion of\nneural correlates of consiousness, to the definition of macroscopic neural\nstates, and to aspects of the symbol grounding problem. In particular, it is\nshown that compatible mental descriptions, topologically equivalent to the\nneurodynamical description, emerge if the partition of the neural phase space\nis generating. If this is not the case, mental descriptions are incompatible or\ncomplementary.

Such models have interesting features, in particular\nKaluza-Klein (KK) number conservation, which makes their phenomenology similar\nto that of supersymmetric theories. Thus, KK excitations of matter are produced\nin pairs, and decay to a lightest KK particle (LKP), which is stable and weakly\ninteracting, and therefore will appear as missing energy in the detector\n(similar to a neutralino LSP). Adding gravitational interactions which can\nbreak KK number conservation greatly expands the class of possible signatures.\nThus, if gravity is the primary cause for the decay of KK excitations of\nmatter, the experimental signals at hadron colliders will be jets + missing\nenergy, which is typical of supergravity models. If the KK quarks and gluons\ndecay first to the LKP, which then decays gravitationally, the experimental\nsignal will be photons and/or leptons (with some jets), which resembles the\nphenomenology of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking models.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 05\n"}

In order\nto synthesize the strategic H/He lines, we have used our recent, line-blanketed\nversion of FASTWIND. First we investigated the predicted behaviour of the\nstrategic lines. In contradiction to what one expects from the optical in the\nO-star regime, almost all photospheric H/HeI/HeII H/K band lines become\nstronger if the gravity decreases. Concerning H and HeII, this finding is\nrelated to the behaviour of Stark broadening as a function of electron density,\nwhich in the line cores is different for members of lower (optical) and higher\n(IR) series. Regarding HeI, the predicted behaviour is due to some subtle NLTE\neffects resulting in a stronger overpopulation of the lower level when the\ngravity decreases.

In general, $A \\otimes\nB$ is not a lattice; for instance, we proved that $M\\_3\\otimes F(3)$ is not a\nlattice. In this paper, we introduce a new lattice construction, the box\nproduct for arbitrary lattices. The tensor product construction for complete\nlattices introduced by G. N. Raney in 1960 and by R.

For lattices A and B, while their\ntensor product $A\\otimes B$ (as semilattices) is not always a lattice, the box\nproduct, $A \\bp B$, is always a lattice. Furthermore, the box product and some\nof its ideals behave like an improved tensor product. For example, if A and B\nare lattices with unit, then the isomorphism $Conc(A $\\bp$ B) \\cong Conc A\n\\otimes Conc B$ holds. There are analogous results for lattices A and B with\nzero and for a bounded lattice A and an arbitrary lattice B.

In the vicinity of the vicinity of the superconductivity-to-Bose metal\ntransition, the resistitivy turns on as $(H-H_c)^{2}$ with $H_c$. This\nfunctional form is in excellent agreement with the experimentally observed\nturn-on of the resistivity in the metallic state in MoGe, namely $R\\approx\nR_c(H-H_c)^\\mu$, $1<\\mu<3$.

Each agent\npicks the momentarily best-performing strategy for decision with the\nperformance of the strategy being a result of the cumulative collective\ndecisions of the agents. The agents may or may not be networked for information\nsharing. Detailed numerical simulations reveal that the system exhibits\nwell-defined plateaux regions in the success rate which are separated from each\nother by abrupt transitions. As $L$ increases, the maximum success rate forms a\nwell defined sequence of simple fractions. We analyze the features by studying\nthe outcome time series, the dynamics of the strategies' performance ranking\npattern and the dynamics in the history space. While the system tends to\nexplore the whole history space due to its competitive nature, an increasing\n$L$ has the effect of driving the system to a restricted portion of the history\nspace. Thus the underlying cause of the observed features is an interesting\nself-organized phenomena in which the system, in response to the global\nresource level, effectively avoids particular patterns of history outcomes.

It depends on three real parameters gamma_i which determine the\nshape of the deformed 5-sphere. The dual gauge theory has the same field\ncontent as N=4 SYM theory, but with scalar and Yukawa interactions ``deformed''\nby gamma_i-dependent phases. The special case of equal deformation parameters\ngamma_i=gamma corresponds to the N=1 supersymmetric deformation. We compare the\nenergies of semiclassical strings with three large angular momenta to the\n1-loop anomalous dimensions of the corresponding gauge-theory scalar operators\nand find that they match as it was the case in the SU(3) sector of the standard\nAdS/CFT duality.

The most likely candidate for the\nquiescent counterpart of the transient has a relatively soft spectrum and an\nunabsorbed 0.5-10 keV luminosity of 2.6E32 ergs/s, quite typical of other\nquiescent neutron stars.

The luminosity gap is used to define \"fossil\" groups; we expect the\nfraction of fossil systems to exhibit a strong and model-independent trend with\nmass: ~1-3% of massive clusters and ~5-40% of groups should be fossil systems.\nWe also show that, on cluster scales, the observed intrinsic scatter in the\ncentral galaxy luminosity-halo mass relation can be ascribed to dispersion in\nthe merger histories of satellites within the cluster. We compare our\npredictions to the luminosity gap distribution in a sample of 730 clusters in\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey C4 Catalog and find good agreement.

The strength of [O III] 5007 is modulated by the covering\nfactor, CF, of the narrow line region (NLR) gas, its density n_e, and\nionization parameter U. To explore which of these factors produces the observed\nlarge range in [O III] 5007 strength, we measure the strength of the matching\nnarrow Hb and [O III] 4363 lines, detected in 40 out of the 87 z<0.5 PG quasars\nin the Boroson & Green sample. The photoionization code CLOUDY is then used to\ninfer CF, n_e, and U in each object, assuming a single uniform emitting zone.\nWe find that the range of CF (~0.02-0.2) contributes about twice as much as the\nrange in both n_e and U towards modulating the strength of the [O III] 5007\nline. The CF is inversely correlated with luminosity, but it is not correlated\nwith L_Edd as previously speculated. The single zone [O III] 5007 emitting\nregion is rather compact, having R=40L_44^0.45 pc.

This set of observations strongly suggests that the inner\nparts of cluster cores are shock-heated every ~10^8 years by intermittent AGN\noutbursts, driven by a kinetic power output of ~ 10^45 erg/sec and lasting at\nleast 10^7 years. Beyond ~30 kpc these shocks decay to sound waves, releasing\nbuoyant bubbles that heat the core's outer parts. Between heating episodes,\ncooling causes the core to relax toward an asymptotic pure-cooling profile. The\ndensity distribution in this asymptotic profile is sufficiently peaked that the\nAGN shock does not cause a core entropy inversion, allowing the cluster core to\nretain a strong iron abundance gradient, as observed.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 05\n"}

{"prompt": "  Using an innovative technique arising from the theory of symmetric spaces, we\nobtain an approximate analytic solution of the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar\n(DMPK) equation in the insulating regime of a metallic carbon nanotube with\nsymplectic symmetry and an odd number of conducting channels. This symmetry\nclass is characterized by the presence of a perfectly conducting channel in the\nlimit of infinite length of the nanotube. The derivation of the DMPK equation\nfor this system has recently been performed by Takane, who also obtained the\naverage conductance both analytically and numerically. Using the Jacobian\ncorresponding to the transformation to radial coordinates and the\nparameterization of the transfer matrix given by Takane, we identify the\nensemble of transfer matrices as the symmetric space of negative curvature\nSO^*(4m+2)/[SU(2m+1)xU(1)] belonging to the DIII-odd Cartan class. We rederive\nthe leading-order correction to the conductance of the perfectly conducting\nchannel <log(delta g)> and its variance Var(log(delta g)). Our results are in\ncomplete agreement with Takane's. In addition, our approach based on the\nmapping to a symmetric space enables us to obtain new universal quantities: a\nuniversal group theoretical expression for the ratio Var(log(delta\ng)/<log(delta g)> and as a byproduct, a novel expression for the localization\nlength for the most general case of a symmetric space with BC_m root system, in\nwhich all three types of roots are present.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 05\n"}

In\nparticular, we are interested in the behavior of the density profiles and\nelectric potential created by the charge and the electrolyte, and in the\ndetermination of the renormalized charge which is obtained from the\nlong-distance asymptotics of the electric potential. In Samaj's previous work,\nexact results for arbitrary coulombic coupling $\\beta$ were obtained for a\nsystem where all the charges are points, provided $\\beta Q<2$ and $\\beta < 2$.\nHere, we first focus on the mean field situation which we believe describes\ncorrectly the limit $\\beta\\to 0$ but $\\beta Q$ large. In this limit we can\nstudy the case when the guest charge is a hard disk and its charge is above the\ncollapse value $\\beta Q>2$. We compare our results for the renormalized charge\nwith the exact predictions and we test on a solid ground some conjectures of\nthe previous study. Our study shows that the exact formulas obtained by Samaj\nfor the renormalized charge are not valid for $\\beta Q>2$, contrary to a\nhypothesis put forward by Samaj. We also determine the short-distance\nasymptotics of the density profiles of the coions and counterions near the\nguest charge, for arbitrary coulombic coupling. We show that the coion density\nprofile exhibit a change of behavior if the guest charge becomes large enough\n($\\beta Q\\geq 2-\\beta$). This is interpreted as a first step of the counterion\ncondensation (for large coulombic coupling), the second step taking place at\nthe usual Manning--Oosawa threshold $\\beta Q=2$.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 05\n"}

{"prompt": "  The analysis of the Lyman-alpha forest of absorption lines in quasar spectra\nhas emerged as a potentially powerful technique to constrain the linear matter\npower spectrum.

This procedure is undesirable in principle as\nit requires the estimation of the unabsorbed quasar continuum level, a\ndifficult undertaking subject to various sources of systematic error and bias.\nWe suggest an alternative approach based on measuring the one-point probability\ndistribution function (pdf) of the fluctuations in the flux about the mean,\nrelative to the mean, i.e. the pdf of delta_f = (f - <f>)/<f>. This statistic,\nwhile sensitive to the amplitude of the ionizing background, has the virtue\nthat its measurement does not require an estimate of the unabsorbed continuum\nlevel. We present a measurement of the pdf of delta_f from seven Keck HIRES\nspectra, spanning a redshift range of z = 2.2 - 4.4. To illustrate that our\nmethod is useful, we compare our measurements of the pdf of delta_f, and\nmeasurements of the flux power spectrum from Croft et al.

From this comparison, we obtain constraints on\nthe mean transmission in the Lyman-alpha forest, the slope of the\ntemperature-density relation, as well as the amplitude and slope of the mass\npower spectrum.

It is shown that the\n{\\it stoichiometric sensitivity} of an intermediary metabolite concentration\nwith respect to changes in steady-state flux is governed by the effective\nequilibrium constant of the intermediate formation, and the equilibrium can be\nregulated by a futile cycle. The direction of the shift in the effective\nequilibrium constant depends on the direction of operation of the futile cycle.\nHigh stoichiometric sensitivity corresponds to ultrasensitivity of an\nintermediate concentration to net flow through a pathway; low stoichiometric\nsensitivity corresponds to super-robustness of concentration with respect to\nchanges in flux. Both cases potentially play important roles in metabolic\nregulation. Futile cycles actively shift the effective equilibrium by expending\nenergy; the magnitude of changes in effective equilibria and sensitivities is a\nfunction of the amount of energy used by a futile cycle. This proposed\nmechanism for control by futile cycles works remarkably similarly to kinetic\nproofreading in biosynthesis. The sensitivity of the system is also intimately\nrelated to the rate of concentration fluctuations of intermediate metabolites.\nThe possibly different roles of the two major mechanisms for cellular\nbiochemical regulation, namely reversible chemical modifications via futile\ncycles and shifting equilibrium by macromolecular binding, are discussed.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 05\n"}

Our main conclusion is that the VL and\nRL zero-points and the uncorrelated residuals can only be reproduced\nsimultaneously if adiabatic contraction is avoided. One or the other could be\nfixed by appealing to unrealistic values for M/L, halo concentration c, and\nspin parameter lambda, but not all together.

If the short period (Porb<10 min) systems accrete at a\nrate consistent with gravitational radiation via direct impact, we predict\ntheir unpulsed optical/UV light to be that of the Teff>50,000$ K accreting WD.\nAt longer Porb we calculate the Teff and absolute visual magnitude, M_V, that\nthe accreting WD will have during low accretion states, and find that the WD\nnaturally crosses the pulsational instability strip. Discovery and study of\npulsations could allow for the measurement of the accumulated helium mass on\nthe accreting WD, as well as its rotation rate. Accretion heats the WD core,\nbut for Porb>40 minutes, the WD's Teff is set by its cooling as <Mdot>\nplummets. For the two long period AM CVn binaries with measured parallaxes, GP\nCom and CE 315, we show that the optical broadband colors and intensity are\nthat expected from a pure helium atmosphere WD. This confirms that the WD\nbrightness sets the minimum light in wide AM CVn binaries, allowing for\nmeaningful constraints on their population density from deep optical searches,\nboth in the field and in Globular Clusters.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 05\n"}

A Pseudo-Fisher Linear Discriminant was built on this\ndissimilarity space. The performance of Discrete Fourier transform (DFT)\ndescriptors, and a combination of both feature types was also evaluated. The\nalgorithms were tested on a 40- and 1196-subjects face database (ORL and FERET,\nrespectively). With 5 images per subject in the training and test datasets,\nerror rate on the ORL database was 3.8, 1.25 and 0.2% for the FBT, DFT, and the\ncombined classifier, respectively, as compared to 2.6% achieved by the best\nprevious algorithm. The most informative polar frequency features were\nconcentrated at low-to-medium angular frequencies coupled to low radial\nfrequencies. On the FERET database, where an affine normalization\npre-processing was applied, the FBT algorithm outperformed only the PCA in a\nrank recognition test.

A\ngeneral theory of calculus culminates by taking limits in Banach spaces, and is\nvalid for domains called ``chainlets'' which are defined to be elements of the\nBanach spaces. Chainlets include manifolds, rough domains (e.g., fractals),\nsoap films, foliations, and Euclidean space. Most of the work is at the level\nof the infinitesimal calculus, at a single point.

The method is applied to open clusters in the solar\nneighbourhood, based on the new cluster sample of Kharchenko et al. From a\ncomparison between the observed and predicted age distributions in the age\nrange between 10 Myr to 3 Gyr we find the following results: (1) The disruption\ntime of a 10^4 M_sun cluster in the solar neighbourhood is about 1.3+/-0.5 Gyr.\nThis is a factor 5 shorter than derived from N-body simulations of clusters in\nthe tidal field of the galaxy. (2) The present starformation rate in bound\nclusters within 600 pc from the Sun is 5.9+/-0.8 * 10^2 M_sun / Myr, which\ncorresponds to a surface star formation rate in bound clusters of 5.2+/-0.7\n10^(-10) M_sun/yr/pc^2. (3) The age distribution of open clusters shows a bump\nbetween 0.26 and 0.6 Gyr when the cluster formation rate was 2.5 times higher\nthan before and after. (4) The present star formation rate in bound clusters is\nhalf as small as that derived from the study of embedded clusters. The\ndifference suggests that half of the clusters in the solar neighbourhood become\nunbound within 10 Myr. (5) The most massive clusters within 600 pc had an\ninitial mass of 3*10^4 M_sun. This is in agreement with the statistically\nexpected value based on a cluster initial mass function with a slope of -2,\neven if the physical upper mass limit is as high as 10^6 M_sun.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 05\n"}
{"prompt": "  Geocasting is the delivery of packets to nodes within a certain geographic\narea. For many applications in wireless ad hoc and sensor networks, geocasting\nis an important and frequent communication service. The challenging problem in\ngeocasting is distributing the packets to all the nodes within the geocast\nregion with high probability but with low overhead. According to our study we\nnotice a clear tradeoff between the proportion of nodes in the geocast region\nthat receive the packet and the overhead incurred by the geocast packet\nespecially at low densities and irregular distributions. We present two novel\nprotocols for geocasting that achieve high delivery rate and low overhead by\nutilizing the local location information of nodes to combine geographic routing\nmechanisms with region flooding. We show that the first protocol\nGeographic-Forwarding-Geocast (GFG) has close-to-minimum overhead in dense\nnetworks and that the second protocol Geographic-Forwarding-Perimeter-Geocast\n(GFPG) provides guaranteed delivery without global flooding or global network\ninformation even at low densities and with the existence of region gaps or\nobstacles. An adaptive version of the second protocol (GFPG*) has the desirable\nproperty of perfect delivery at all densities and close-to-minimum overhead at\nhigh densities. We evaluate our mechanisms and compare them using simulation to\nother proposed geocasting mechanisms. The results show the significant\nimprovement in delivery rate (up to 63% higher delivery percentage in low\ndensity networks) and reduction in overhead (up to 80% reduction) achieved by\nour mechanisms. We hope for our protocols to become building block mechanisms\nfor dependable sensor network architectures that require robust efficient\ngeocast services.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 05\n"}
{"prompt": "  High-temperature superconductivity has been discovered in La2-xBaxCuO4 [1], a\ncompound that derives from the undoped La2CuO4 crystallizing in the perovskite\nT-structure. In this structure oxygen octahedra surround the copper ions. It is\ncommon knowledge that charge carriers induced by doping in such an undoped\nantiferromagnetic Mott-insulator lead to high-temperature superconductivity [2-\n4]. The undoped material La2CuO4 is also the basis of the electron-doped\ncuprate superconductors [5] of the form La2-xCexCuO4+y [6,7] which however\ncrystallize in the so called T-prime-structure, i.e. without apical oxygen\nabove or below the copper ions of the CuO2-plane. It is well known that for\nLa2-xCexCuO4+y the undoped T-prime-structure parent compound cannot be prepared\ndue to the structural phase transition back into the T-structure occuring\naround x ~ 0.05. Here, we report that if La is substituted by RE = Y, Lu, Sm,\nEu, Gd, or Tb, which have smaller ionic radii but have the same valence as La,\nnominally undoped La2-xRExCuO4 can be synthesized by molecular beam epitaxy in\nthe T-prime-structure. The second important result is that all these new\nT-prime-compounds are superconductors with fairly high critical temperatures up\nto 21 K. For this new class of cuprates La2-xRExCuO4, which forms the\nT-prime-parent compounds of the La-based electron doped cuprates, we have not\nbeen able to obtain the Mott-insulating ground state for small x before the\nstructural phase transition into the T-structure takes place.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 05\n"}

{"prompt": "  To test the existence of a possible radial gradient in oxygen abundances\nwithin the Local Group dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 6822, we have obtained\noptical spectra of 19 nebulae with the EFOSC2 spectrograph on the 3.6-m\ntelescope at ESO La Silla. The extent of the measured nebulae spans\ngalactocentric radii in the range between 0.05 kpc and 2 kpc (over four\nexponential scale lengths). In five H II regions (Hubble I, Hubble V, Kalpha,\nKbeta, KD28e), the temperature-sensitive [O III] 4363 emission line was\ndetected, and direct oxygen abundances were derived. Oxygen abundances for the\nremaining H II regions were derived using bright-line methods. The oxygen\nabundances for three A-type supergiant stars are slightly higher than nebular\nvalues at comparable radii. Linear least-square fits to various subsets of\nabundance data were obtained. When all of the measured nebulae are included, no\nclear signature is found for an abundance gradient. A fit to only newly\nobserved H II regions with [O III] 4363 detections yields an oxygen abundance\ngradient of -0.14 +/- 0.07 dex/kpc. The gradient becomes slightly more\nsignificant (-0.16 +/- 0.05 dex/kpc) when three additional H II regions with [O\nIII] 4363 measurements from the literature are added. Assuming no abundance\ngradient, we derive a mean nebular oxygen abundance 12+log(O/H) = 8.11 +/- 0.10\nfrom [O III] 4363 detections in the five H II regions from our present data;\nthis mean value corresponds to [O/H] = -0.55.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 05\n"}
{"prompt": "  This paper investigates correlation properties of fluctuations in fatigue\ncrack growth of polycrystalline materials, such as ductile alloys, that are\ncommonly encountered in structures and machinery components of complex\nelectromechanical systems. The model of crack damage measure indicates that the\nfluctuations of fatigue crack growth are characterized by strong correlation\npatterns within short time scales and are uncorrelated for larger time scales.\nThe two correlation regimes suggest that the 7075-T6 aluminum alloy, analyzed\nin this paper, is characterized by a micro-structure which is responsible for\nan intermittent correlated dynamics of fatigue crack growth within a certain\nscale. The constitutive equations of the damage measure are built upon the\nphysics of fracture mechanics and are substantiated by Karhunen-Lo\\`{e}ve\ndecomposition of fatigue test data.

This framework is non\ntrivially predictive in the fermionic sector and connects in a natural way the\nGUT unification of b and tau Yukawa couplings with the bi-large mixing scenario\nfor neutrinos. On the other hand, existing numerical analysis claim that\nconsistency with quark and charged lepton data prevents the minimal setup from\nreproducing the observed CP violation via the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM)\nmatrix. We re-examine the issue and find by inspection of the fermion mass sum\nrules and a detailed numerical scan that, even though the CKM phase takes\npreferentially values in the second quadrant, the agreement of the minimal\nmodel with the data is actually obtained in a non negligible fraction of the\nparameter space.
