{"prompt": "  In this paper, we deal with a generalization of the geometry of\nparallelizable manifolds, or the absolute parallelism (AP-) geometry, in the\ncontext of generalized Lagrange spaces. All geometric objects defined in this\ngeometry are not only functions of the positional argument $x$, but also depend\non the directional argument $y$. In other words, instead of dealing with\ngeometric objects defined on the manifold $M$, as in the case of classical\nAP-geometry, we are dealing with geometric objects in the pullback bundle\n$\\pi^{-1}(TM)$ (the pullback of the tangent bundle $TM$ by $ \\pi: T\nM\\longrightarrow M$). Many new geometric objects, which have no counterpart in\nthe classical AP-geometry, emerge in this more general context. We refer to\nsuch a geometry as generalized AP-geometry (GAP-geometry). In analogy to\nAP-geometry, we define a $d$-connection in $\\pi^{-1}(TM)$ having remarkable\nproperties, which we call the canonical $d$-connection, in terms of the unique\ntorsion-free Riemannian $d$-connection. In addition to these two\n$d$-connections, two more $d$-connections are defined, the dual and the\nsymmetric $d$-connections. Our space, therefore, admits twelve curvature\ntensors (corresponding to the four defined $d$-connections), three of which\nvanish identically. Simple formulae for the nine non-vanishing curvatures\ntensors are obtained, in terms of the torsion tensors of the canonical\n$d$-connection.

{"prompt": "  By 2D hydrodynamic simulations including a detailed equation of state and\nneutrino transport, we investigate the interplay between different non-radial\nhydrodynamic instabilities that play a role during the postbounce accretion\nphase of collapsing stellar cores. The convective mode of instability, which is\ndriven by negative entropy gradients caused by neutrino heating or by time\nvariations of the shock strength, can be identified clearly by the development\nof typical Rayleigh-Taylor mushrooms. However, in cases where the gas in the\npostshock region is rapidly advected towards the gain radius, the growth of\nsuch a buoyancy instability can be suppressed. In such a situation the shocked\nflow nevertheless can develop non-radial asymmetry with an oscillatory growth\nof the amplitude. This phenomenon has been termed ``standing accretion shock\ninstability'' (SASI). It is shown here that the SASI oscillations can trigger\nconvective instability and like the latter they lead to an increase of the\naverage shock radius and of the mass in the gain layer. Both hydrodynamic\ninstabilities in combination stretch the advection time of matter through the\nneutrino-heating layer and thus enhance the neutrino energy deposition in\nsupport of the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. A rapidly contracting and\nmore compact nascent NS turns out to be favorable for explosions, because the\naccretion luminosity and neutrino heating are larger and the growth rate of the\nSASI is higher. Moreover, we show that the oscillation period of the SASI and a\nvariety of other features in our simulations agree with estimates for the\nadvective-acoustic cycle (AAC), in which perturbations are carried by the\naccretion flow from the shock to the neutron star and pressure waves close an\namplifying global feedback loop.

These waves possess (i) the\nRayleigh-Jeans distribution and (ii) zero correlations between waves, just as\nnoninteracting free waves would. This renormalization is achieved through a set\nof canonical transformations. The renormalized linear dispersion of these\nrenormalized waves is obtained and shown to be in excellent agreement with\nnumerical experiments. Moreover, a dynamical interpretation of the\nrenormalization of the dispersion relation is provided via a self-consistency,\nmean-field argument.

Although some sources show a flattening of the radio spectral\nslope at high frequencies the average spectrum shows a steepening of the radio\nspectrum from 1.4 to 22.5 GHz. This is unexpected because in sources with high\nrates of star formation we expect flat spectrum, free-free emission to make a\nsignificant contribution to the radio flux at higher radio frequencies. Despite\nthis trend the radio spectral indices between 8.4 and 22.5 GHz are flatter for\nsources with higher values of the FIR-radio flux density ratio q, when this is\ncalculated at 8.4 GHz. Therefore, sources that are deficient in radio emission\nrelative to FIR emission (presumably younger sources) have a larger thermal\ncomponent to their radio emission.

Furthermore, after appropriate rescaling the evolving\nnetworks converge to a self-similarly shrinking network, which we prove to be\nunique in an appropriate class.

{"prompt": "  We present a simple form of the on-shell gauge-invariant 1-loop effective\naction of N=8 supergravity which is manifestly N=8 supersymmetric at the linear\nlevel. By generalizing the dimensional arguments in superspace to non-local\ninvariants, we show that the 1-loop effective action does not contain any\ncontributions from bubble and triangle diagrams. The absence of bubbles implies\nthe absence of conformal and axial anomalies. We also show that the 1-loop\neffective action of N=8 supergravity features a \"dual\" conformal symmetry in\nthe momentum space.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2007"}

{"prompt": "  We discuss tachyon-free examples of (Type IIB on) non-compact\nnon-supersymmetric orbifolds. Tachyons are projected out by discrete torsion\nbetween orbifold twists, while supersymmetry is broken by a Scherk-Schwarz\nphase (+1/-1 when acting on space-time bosons/fermions) accompanying some even\norder twists. The absence of tachyons is encouraging for constructing\nnon-supersymmetric D3-brane gauge theories with stable infrared fixed points.\nThe D3-brane gauge theories in our orbifold backgrounds have chiral N = 1\nsupersymmetric spectra, but non-supersymmetric interactions.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2007"}
{"prompt": "  As shown in earlier work (Ahlers et al., J. Fluid Mech. 569, p.409 (2006)),\nnon-Oberbeck Boussinesq (NOB) corrections to the center temperature in\nturbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection in water and also in glycerol are governed\nby the temperature dependences of the kinematic viscosity and the thermal\ndiffusion coefficient. If the working fluid is ethane close to the critical\npoint the origin of non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq corrections is very different, as\nwill be shown in the present paper. Namely, the main origin of NOB corrections\nthen lies in the strong temperature dependence of the isobaric thermal\nexpansion coefficient \\beta(T). More precisely, it is the nonlinear\nT-dependence of the density \\rho(T) in the buoyancy force which causes another\ntype of NOB effect. We demonstrate that through a combination of experimental,\nnumerical, and theoretical work, the latter in the framework of the extended\nPrandtl-Blasius boundary layer theory developed in Ahlers et al., J. Fluid\nMech. 569, p.409 (2006). The latter comes to its limits, if the temperature\ndependence of the thermal expension coefficient \\beta(T) is significant.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2007"}
{"prompt": "  We study the orbits of $G=\\mathrm{GL}(V)$ in the enhanced nilpotent cone\n$V\\times\\mathcal{N}$, where $\\mathcal{N}$ is the variety of nilpotent\nendomorphisms of $V$. These orbits are parametrized by bipartitions of $n=\\dim\nV$, and we prove that the closure ordering corresponds to a natural partial\norder on bipartitions. Moreover, we prove that the local intersection\ncohomology of the orbit closures is given by certain bipartition analogues of\nKostka polynomials, defined by Shoji. Finally, we make a connection with Kato's\nexotic nilpotent cone in type C, proving that the closure ordering is the same,\nand conjecturing that the intersection cohomology is the same but with degrees\ndoubled.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2007"}
{"prompt": "  In the past few years, a lot of evidences have been accumulated, which\nindicate that the gluon polarization inside the nucleon is likely to be small\nat least at the low renormalization scales. On the other hand, the recent\nlattice QCD analyses suggest that the net orbital angular momentum carried by\nthe quarks is nearly zero. There is also some indication noticed by Brodsky and\nGardner based on the COMPASS observation of small single-spin asymmetry on the\nisoscalar deuteron target, that the gluon orbital angular momentum inside the\nnucleon is likely to be small. Naively combining all these observations, we are\nled to a rather embarrassing conclusion that the nucleon constituents\naltogether do not carry enough amount of angular momentum saturating the total\nnucleon spin. We show that this somewhat confused state of affairs can be\ncleared up only by paying careful attention to the scale dependencies of the\nnucleon spin decomposition.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2007"}
{"prompt": "  Lovasz and Schrijver, and later Lasserre, proposed hierarchies of\nsemidefinite programming relaxations for general 0/1 linear programming\nproblems. In this paper these two constructions are revisited and two new,\nblock-diagonal hierarchies are proposed. They have the advantage of being\ncomputationally less costly while being at least as strong as the\nLovasz-Schrijver hierarchy. Our construction is applied to the stable set\nproblem and experimental results for Paley graphs are reported.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2007"}
{"prompt": "  The vortex state of mesoscopic three-dimensional superconductors is\ndetermined using a minimization procedure of the Ginzburg-Landau free energy.\nWe obtain the vortex pattern for a mesoscopic superconducting sphere and find\nthat vortex lines are naturally bent and are closest to each other at the\nequatorial plane. For a superconducting disk with finite height, and under an\napplied magnetic field perpendicular to its major surface, we find that our\nmethod gives results consistent with previous calculations. The matching\nfields, the magnetization and $H_{c3}$, are obtained for models that differ\naccording to their boundary properties. A change of the Ginzburg-Landau\nparameters near the surface can substantially enhance $H_{c3}$ as shown here.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2007"}
