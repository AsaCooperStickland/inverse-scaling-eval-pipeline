Results:\nin general, for models with a constant water abundance, the ground state lines,\ni.e., 1_(10)-1_(01), 1_(11)-0_(00), and 2_(12)-1_(01), are predicted in\nabsorption, all the others in emission. This behaviour changes for models with\na water abundance jump profile in that the line profiles for jumps by a factor\nof ~10-100 are similar to the line shapes in the constant abundance models,\nwhereas larger jumps lead to emission profiles. Asymmetric line profiles are\nfound for models with a cavity outflow and depend on the inclination angle.\nModels with an outflow cavity are favoured to reproduce the SWAS observations\nof the 1_(10)-1_(01) ground-state transition.

Depending on the sign of the gradient of the specific\nvorticity of the disc the corotation resonance can either enhance or diminish\nthe super-reflectivity, and this can be understood in terms of the location of\nthe Rossby wave zone relative to the corotation radius. Our results provide the\nexplicit conditions (in terms of disc thickness, rotation profile and specific\nvorticity gradient) for which super-reflection can be achieved. Global\noverstable disc modes may be possible for discs with super-reflection at the\ncorotation barrier.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 07\n"}

Collective degrees of freedom\ngovern essential aspects of nuclear structure, and for several decades the\nstudy of collective modes such as rotations and vibrations has played a vital\nrole in our understanding of complex properties of nuclei. The multipole\nresponse of unstable nuclei and the possible occurrence of new exotic modes of\nexcitation in weakly-bound nuclear systems, present a rapidly growing field of\nresearch, but only few experimental studies of these phenomena have been\nreported so far. Valuable data on the evolution of the low-energy dipole\nresponse in unstable neutron-rich nuclei have been gathered in recent\nexperiments, but the available information is not sufficient to determine the\nnature of observed excitations. Even in stable nuclei various modes of giant\ncollective oscillations had been predicted by theory years before they were\nobserved, and for that reason it is very important to perform detailed\ntheoretical studies of the evolution of collective modes of excitation in\nnuclei far from stability. We therefore discuss the modern theoretical tools\nthat have been developed in recent years for the description of collective\nexcitations in weakly-bound nuclei. The review focuses on the applications of\nthese models to studies of the evolution of low-energy dipole modes from stable\nnuclei to systems near the particle emission threshold, to analyses of various\nisoscalar modes, those for which data are already available, as well as those\nthat could be observed in future experiments, to a description of\ncharge-exchange modes and their evolution in neutron-rich nuclei, and to\nstudies of the role of exotic low-energy modes in astrophysical processes.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 07\n"}

In this paper, we specify a general\nstochastic SIR epidemic model and prove that the mean generation interval\ndecreases when susceptible persons are at risk of infectious contact from\nmultiple sources. The intuition behind this is that when a susceptible person\nhas multiple potential infectors, there is a ``race'' to infect him or her in\nwhich only the first infectious contact leads to infection. In an epidemic, the\nmean generation interval contracts as the prevalence of infection increases. We\ncall this global competition among potential infectors.

{"prompt": "  We study three wave function optimization methods based on energy\nminimization in a variational Monte Carlo framework: the Newton, linear and\nperturbative methods. In the Newton method, the parameter variations are\ncalculated from the energy gradient and Hessian, using a reduced variance\nstatistical estimator for the latter. In the linear method, the parameter\nvariations are found by diagonalizing a non-symmetric estimator of the\nHamiltonian matrix in the space spanned by the wave function and its\nderivatives with respect to the parameters, making use of a strong\nzero-variance principle. In the less computationally expensive perturbative\nmethod, the parameter variations are calculated by approximately solving the\ngeneralized eigenvalue equation of the linear method by a nonorthogonal\nperturbation theory. These general methods are illustrated here by the\noptimization of wave functions consisting of a Jastrow factor multiplied by an\nexpansion in configuration state functions (CSFs) for the C$_2$ molecule,\nincluding both valence and core electrons in the calculation. The Newton and\nlinear methods are very efficient for the optimization of the Jastrow, CSF and\norbital parameters. The perturbative method is a good alternative for the\noptimization of just the CSF and orbital parameters. Although the optimization\nis performed at the variational Monte Carlo level, we observe for the C$_2$\nmolecule studied here, and for other systems we have studied, that as more\nparameters in the trial wave functions are optimized, the diffusion Monte Carlo\ntotal energy improves monotonically, implying that the nodal hypersurface also\nimproves monotonically.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 07\n"}

{"prompt": "  We study the S parameter, considering especially its sign, in models of\nelectroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) in extra dimensions, with fermions\nlocalized near the UV brane. Such models are conjectured to be dual to 4D\nstrong dynamics triggering EWSB. The motivation for such a study is that a\nnegative value of S can significantly ameliorate the constraints from\nelectroweak precision data on these models, allowing lower mass scales (TeV or\nbelow) for the new particles and leading to easier discovery at the LHC. We\nfirst extend an earlier proof of S>0 for EWSB by boundary conditions in\narbitrary metric to the case of general kinetic functions for the gauge fields\nor arbitrary kinetic mixing. We then consider EWSB in the bulk by a Higgs VEV\nshowing that S is positive for arbitrary metric and Higgs profile, assuming\nthat the effects from higher-dimensional operators in the 5D theory are\nsub-leading and can therefore be neglected. For the specific case of AdS_5 with\na power law Higgs profile, we also show that S ~ + O(1), including effects of\npossible kinetic mixing from higher-dimensional operator (of NDA size) in the\n$5D$ theory.

Magnetotransport\nmeasurements of Hall-bars made in this manner display the characteristic\nproperties of the hole-mediated ferromagnetic phase, which result from good\npattern isolation. Arrays of Ga1-xMnxAs dots as small as 250 nm across have\nbeen realized by this process. The second process consists of blanket\nhydrogenation of Ga1-xMnxAs followed by local reactivation using confined\nlow-power pulsed-laser annealing.

We present\nhere the two-dimensional line-strength maps for each galaxy. From the maps, we\nlearn that late-type spiral galaxies tend to have high Hbeta and low Fe5015 and\nMgb values, and that the Hbeta index has often a positive gradient over the\nfield, while the metal indices peak in the central region.

The mass function for\nPraesepe (t~600 Myr; M~500 Msun) follows a power law consistent with that of\nthe field present-day mass function, suggesting that any mass-dependent tidal\nstripping could have removed only the lowest-mass members (<0.15 Msun).

The network\nperformance is measured by the achievable relay rates from the sources to\ndestinations under latency and medium access constraints. In particular,\nanalytical results are presented for two scenarios:\n  For a two-hop network with maximum anonymity, achievable rate regions for a\ngeneral m x 1 relay are characterized when nodes generate independent Poisson\ntransmission schedules. The rate regions are presented for both strict and\naverage delay constraints on traffic flow through the relay.\n  For a multihop network with an arbitrary anonymity requirement, the problem\nof maximizing the sum-rate of flows (network throughput) is considered. A\nselective independent scheduling strategy is designed for this purpose, and\nusing the analytical results for the two-hop network, the achievable throughput\nis characterized as a function of the anonymity level.

However, a number of methods have\nbeen used to convert from source intensities to luminosities when creating\nthese XLFs. We have taken advantage of the XMM-Newton observations of the\nnearby starbursting spiral galaxy NGC 253 to test some of these methods.

Certainly, the line-of-sight absorption should be determined from the\nobservations rather than assuming Galactic absorption.

The two-dimensional magnetic field is solved in the finite\nplasma pressure regime, or finite $\\beta$ regime, and it is described by an\nequation where plasma pressure plays the role of an eigenvalue. This allows a\nstructure of magnetic lobes in space, among which the polar axis lobe is\nstrongly peaked in intensity and collimated in angular spread comparing to the\nothers. For this reason, the polar lobe overwhelmes the other lobes, and a jet\nstructure arises in the polar direction naturally. Furthermore, within each\nmagnetic lobe in space, there are small secondary regions with closed\ntwo-dimensional field lines embedded along this primary lobe. In these embedded\nmagnetic toroids, plasma pressure and mass density are much higher accordingly.\nThese are termed as secondary plasmoids. The magnetic field lines in these\nsecondary plasmoids circle in alternating sequence such that adjacent plasmoids\nhave opposite field lines.

We model the\ninterferometric data and the spectral energy distribution of MWC 147 with 2-D,\nfrequency-dependent radiation transfer simulations. This analysis shows that\nmodels of spherical envelopes or passive irradiated Keplerian disks (with\nvertical or curved puffed-up inner rim) can easily fit the SED, but predict\nmuch lower visibilities than observed; the angular size predicted by such\nmodels is 2 to 4 times larger than the size derived from the interferometric\ndata, so these models can clearly be ruled out.

We compare the data on SLX 1737-282 with the\nother similar objects and attempt to derive constraints on the physical\nprocesses responsible for the formation of intermediate long bursts. Methods:\nUp to now only three intermediate long bursts, all with duration between ~15-30\nminutes, have been recorded for SLX 1737-282. The properties of two\nintermediate long X-ray bursts observed by INTEGRAL from SLX 1737-282 are\ninvestigated. The broadband spectrum of the persistent emission in the 3-100\nkeV energy band is studied with the INTEGRAL data. Results: The persistent\nemission is measured to be < 1% Eddington luminosity. From the photospheric\nradius expansion observed during the bursts we derive the source distance at\n7.3 kpc. The observed intermediate long burst properties from SLX 1737-282 are\nconsistent with helium ignition at the column depth of 7-8 x 10E-9 g cm-2 and a\nburst energy release of 1E41 erg.

{"prompt": "  Beginning with a straightforward formulation of electromagnetic cloaking that\nreduces to a boundary value problem involving a single Maxwell first-order\ndifferential equation, explicit formulae for the relative\npermittivity-permeability dyadic and fields of spherical and circular\ncylindrical annular cloaks are derived in terms of general compressed radial\ncoordinate functions. The general formulation is based on the requirements that\nthe cloaking occurs for all possible incident fields and that the cloaks with\nfrequency w > 0 have continuous tangential E and H fields across their outer\nsurfaces, and zero normal D and B fields at their inner material surfaces. The\ntangential-field boundary conditions at the outer surface of the cloak ensure\nzero scattered fields, and the normal-field boundary conditions at the inner\nsurface of the cloak are compatible with zero total fields inside the interior\ncavity of the cloak. For spherical cloaks, unlike cylindrical cloaks, these\nboundary conditions lead to all the tangential components of the E and H fields\nbeing continuously zero across their inner surfaces -- cylindrical cloaks\nhaving delta functions in polarization densities at their inner surfaces. For\nbodies with no interior free-space cavities, the formulation is used to derive\nnonscattering spherical and cylindrical concentrators that magnify the incident\nfields near their centers. For static fields (w = 0), the boundary value\nformulation is appropriately modified to obtain a permeability dyadic that will\ncloak magnetostatic fields.

Although\nthis difference decreases with time, after 8 central cooling times, when\nsimulations are stopped, the difference still amounts to a factor of 2-3. We\nascribe this difference to the lack of validity of the assumption that a mass\nshell takes one cooling time, as computed on the initial conditions, to cool to\nvery low temperature.

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented\nhere that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to\nradio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that\nthe high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been\npushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large\nintrinsic component in their redshifts. An increase in luminosity below z =\n0.06 is also seen. It is associated in the DIR model with an increase in\nluminosity as the sources mature but, if real, is difficult to interpret in the\ncosmological redshift (CR) model since at this low redshift it is unlikely to\nbe associated with a higher star formation rate or an increase in the material\nused to build galaxies.

{"prompt": "  Precision measurement of the scalar perturbation spectral index, n_s, from\nthe Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe temperature angular power spectrum\nrequires the subtraction of unresolved point source power. Here we reconsider\nthis issue. First, we note a peculiarity in the WMAP temperature likelihood's\nresponse to the source correction: Cosmological parameters do not respond to\nincreased source errors. An alternative and more direct method for treating\nthis error term acts more sensibly, and also shifts n_s by ~0.3 sigma closer to\nunity. Second, we re-examine the source fit used to correct the power spectrum.\nThis fit depends strongly on the galactic cut and the weighting of the map,\nindicating that either the source population or masking procedure is not\nisotropic. Jackknife tests appear inconsistent, causing us to assign large\nuncertainties to account for possible systematics. Third, we note that the WMAP\nteam's spectrum was computed with two different weighting schemes: uniform\nweights transition to inverse noise variance weights at l = 500. The fit\ndepends on such weighting schemes, so different corrections apply to each\nmultipole range. For the Kp2 mask used in cosmological analysis, we prefer\nsource corrections A = 0.012 +/- 0.005 muK^2 for uniform weighting and A =\n0.015 +/- 0.005 muK^2 for N_obs weighting.

This\nn_s is only 1.8 sigma from unity, compared to the ~2.6 sigma WMAP 3-year\nresult.

The low radio flux\nemitted by this object, however, is inconsistent with a hard state\ninterpretation.

Here we present an\nimproved X-ray PSD of NGC 3783, spanning from ~10^{-8} to ~10^{-3} Hz, based on\nconsiderably extended (5.5 years) RXTE observations combined with two orbits of\ncontinuous observation by XMM-Newton.

{"prompt": "  For the investigation of collisions among protoplanetesimal dust aggregates,\nwe performed microgravity experiments in which the impacts of high-porosity\nmm-sized dust aggregates into 2.5 cm-sized high-porosity dust aggregates can be\nstudied. The dust aggregates consisted of micrometer-sized dust grains and were\nproduced by random ballistic deposition with porosities between 85% and 93%.\nImpact velocities ranged from ~0.1 m/s to ~3 m/s and impact angles were almost\nrandomly distributed. We also used \"molded\" target aggregates such that the\nradii of the local surface curvatures corresponded to the projectile radii. The\nexperiments showed that impacts into the highest-porosity targets almost always\nled to sticking, whereas for the less porous dust aggregates, the collisions\nwith intermediate velocities and high impact angles resulted in the bouncing of\nthe projectile with a mass transfer from the target to the projectile\naggregate. Sticking probabilities for the impacts into the \"molded\" target\naggregates were considerably decreased. For the impacts into smooth targets, we\nmeasured the depth of intrusion and the crater volume and could derive some\ninteresting dynamical properties which can help to derive a collision model for\nprotoplanetesimal dust aggregates. Future models of the aggregate growth in\nprotoplanetary disks should take into account non-central impacts, impact\ncompression, the influence of the local radius of curvature on the collisional\noutcome and the possible mass transfer between target and projectile\nagglomerates in non-sticking collisions.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 07\n"}

{"prompt": "  The optical-UV component in GRB 060218 is assumed to be due to optically\nthick cyclotron emission. The key aspect of this model is the high temperature\nof the absorbing electrons. The heat input derives from nuclei accelerated in\nsemi-relativistic internal shocks, like in ordinary gamma-ray bursts. Coulomb\ncollisions transfer part of that energy to electrons. Inverse Compton cooling\non the X-ray photons leads to electron temperatures around 100 keV. Such a high\nbrightness temperature for the optical-UV emission implies an emitting area\nroughly equal to that of the thermal X-ray component. This suggests a model in\nwhich the radio, optical-UV and thermal X-ray emission are closely related:\nAlthough the optical-UV and thermal X-ray emission are two separate spectral\ncomponents, it is argued that they both come from the photosphere of a\nquasi-spherical, continuous outflow, whose interaction with the circumstellar\nmedium gives rise to the radio emission. The properties of GRB 060218, as\nmeasured in the co-moving frame, are similar to those of ordinary gamma-ray\nburst; i.e., the main difference is the much lower value of the bulk Lorentz\nfactor in GRB 060218.

At the microscopic level, such a\ndependence may be caused by different reasons: The non-stationary Higgs\nmechanism, the influence of a mean field or condensate, the presence of the\nconformal multiplier in the scalar-tensor gravitation theory etc. In what\nfollows, a kinetic theory in the collisionless approximation is developed for\nscalar, spinor and massive vector fields in the framework of the oscillator\nrepresentation, which is an effective tool for transition to the quasiparticle\ndescription and for derivation of non-Markovian kinetic equations. Properties\nof these equations and relevant observables (particle number and energy\ndensities, pressure) are studied.

All geometric objects defined in this\ngeometry are not only functions of the positional argument $x$, but also depend\non the directional argument $y$. In other words, instead of dealing with\ngeometric objects defined on the manifold $M$, as in the case of classical\nAP-geometry, we are dealing with geometric objects in the pullback bundle\n$\\pi^{-1}(TM)$ (the pullback of the tangent bundle $TM$ by $ \\pi: T\nM\\longrightarrow M$). Many new geometric objects, which have no counterpart in\nthe classical AP-geometry, emerge in this more general context. We refer to\nsuch a geometry as generalized AP-geometry (GAP-geometry). In analogy to\nAP-geometry, we define a $d$-connection in $\\pi^{-1}(TM)$ having remarkable\nproperties, which we call the canonical $d$-connection, in terms of the unique\ntorsion-free Riemannian $d$-connection. In addition to these two\n$d$-connections, two more $d$-connections are defined, the dual and the\nsymmetric $d$-connections. Our space, therefore, admits twelve curvature\ntensors (corresponding to the four defined $d$-connections), three of which\nvanish identically. Simple formulae for the nine non-vanishing curvatures\ntensors are obtained, in terms of the torsion tensors of the canonical\n$d$-connection. The different $W$-tensors admitted by the space are also\ncalculated. All contractions of the $h$- and $v$-curvature tensors and the\n$W$-tensors are derived. Second rank symmetric and skew-symmetric tensors,\nwhich prove useful in physical applications, are singled out.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 07\n"}

{"prompt": "  We present a study of the evolved stellar populations in the dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxy Fornax based on JHK imaging photometry.

Deeeper observations reaching the\nred clump of helium-burning stars have also been obtained for a 4.5 x 4.5\narcmin region. Near-infrared photometry led to measurements of the distance to\nFornax based on the K-band location of the RGB tip and the red clump. Once\ncorrected for the mean age of the stellar populations in the galaxy, the\nderived distance modulus is 20.74 corresponding to a distance of 141 Kpc, in\ngood agreement with estimates from optical data. By taking age effects into\naccount, we have derived a distribution function of global metallicity [M/H]\nfrom optical-infrared colors of individual stars.

{"prompt": "  Context: Line asymmetries are generated by convective Doppler shifts in\nstellar atmospheres, especially in metal-poor stars, where convective motions\npenetrate to higher atmospheric levels. Such asymmetries are usually neglected\nin abundance analyses. The determination of the 6Li/7Li isotopic ratio is prone\nto suffering from such asymmetries, as the contribution of 6Li is a slight\nblending reinforcement of the red wing of each component of the corresponding\n7Li line, with respect to its blue wing. Aims: The present paper studies the\nhalo star HD 74000 and estimates the impact of convection-related asymmetries\non the Li isotopic ratio determination. Method: Two methods are used to meet\nthis aim. The first, which is purely empirical, consists in deriving a template\nprofile from another element that can be assumed to originate in the same\nstellar atmospheric layers as Li I, producing absorption lines of approximately\nthe same equivalent width as individual components of the 7Li I resonance line.\nThe second method consists in conducting the abundance analysis based on NLTE\nline formation in a 3D hydrodynamical model atmosphere, taking into account the\neffects of photospheric convection. Results: The results of the first method\nshow that the convective asymmetry generates an excess absorption in the red\nwing of the 7Li absorption feature that mimics the presence of 6Li at a level\ncomparable to the hitherto published values. This opens the possibility that\nonly an upper limit on 6Li/7Li has thus far been derived. The second method\nconfirms these findings.

We also check for the\nrobustness of these results when varying the degree heterogeneity along a\none-parametric family of networks interpolating between the class of\nErdos-Renyi graphs and the Barabasi-Albert networks.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 07\n"}

While the lattice degrees of freedom are classical\nfunctions of time and are integrated out exactly, the electron particle paths\nare treated quantum mechanically. The method accounts for the variable range of\nthe electronic hopping processes. The free energy of the system and its\ntemperature derivatives are computed by summing at any $T$ over the ensemble of\nrelevant particle paths which mainly contribute to the total partition\nfunction. In the low $T$ regime, the {\\it heat capacity over T} ratio shows un\nupturn peculiar to a glass-like behavior. This feature is more sizeable in the\nsquare lattice than in the linear chain as the overall hopping potential\ncontribution to the total action is larger in higher dimensionality.

Different scenarios which lead to an\nincreased Li surface abundance in AGB stars are discussed.\n  Conclusions: Of the different enrichment scenarios presented, Cool Bottom\nProcessing (CBP) is the most likely one for the Li-rich objects identified\nhere. Self-enrichment by Hot Bottom Burning (HBB) seems very unlikely as all\nLi-rich stars are below the HBB mass limit. Also, the ingestion of a low mass\ncompanion into the stars' envelope is unlikely because the associated\nadditional effects are lacking. Mass transfer from a former massive binary\ncompanion is a possible scenario, if the companion produced little s-process\nelements.

At the latter epoch spectropolarimetry was also\nattempted, yielding an upper limit of ~ 2% for the polarization. The spectra\nshow strong emission lines of [OI] and MgI], as expected from a Type Ic\nsupernova, but weak CaII lines. The [FeII] lines that were strong in the\nspectra of SN 1998bw are much weaker in SN 2006aj, consistent with the lower\nluminosity of this SN. The outer velocity of the line-emitting ejecta is ~ 8000\nkm/s in July and ~ 7400 km/s in September, consistent with the relatively low\nkinetic energy of expansion of SN 2006aj. All emission lines have similar\nwidth, and the profiles are symmetric, indicating that no major asymmetries are\npresent in the ejecta at the velocities sampled by the nebular lines (v < 8000\nkm/s), except perhaps in the innermost part. The spectra were modelled with a\nnon-LTE code. The mass of 56Ni required to power the emission spectrum is ~\n0.20 Msun, in excellent agreement with the results of early light curve\nmodelling. The oxygen mass is ~ 1.5 Msun, again much less than in SN 1998bw but\nlarger by ~ 0.7 Msun than the value derived from the early-time modelling. The\ntotal ejected mass is ~ 2 Msun below 8000 km/s. This confirms that SN 2006aj\nwas only slightly more massive and energetic than the prototypical Type Ic SN\n1994I, but also indicates the presence of a dense inner core, containing ~ 1\nMsun of mostly oxygen and carbon. The presence of such a core is inferred for\nall broad-lined SNe Ic. This core may have the form of an equatorial\noxygen-dominated region, but it is too deep to affect the early light curve and\ntoo small to affect the late polarization spectrum.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 07\n"}

By this method, we unambiguously\nconfirm that initial data with an arbitrarily large AH area do exist.

We further\ninvestigate what kind of configuration realizes the minimum mass for the same\nAH area. The configuration that realizes the smallest mass turns out to be the\none close to the BS truncated by a cap.

{"prompt": "  The electron doping of undoped high-$T_c$ cuprates via the transfer of charge\nfrom manganites (or other oxides) using heterostructure geometries is here\ntheoretically discussed. This possibility is mainly addressed via a detailed\nanalysis of photoemission and diffusion voltage experiments, which locate the\nFermi level of manganites above the bottom of the upper Hubbard band of some\ncuprate parent compounds. A diagram with the relative location of Fermi levels\nand gaps for several oxides is presented. The procedure discussed here is\ngeneric, allowing for the qualitative prediction of the charge flow direction\nat several oxide interfaces. The addition of electrons to antiferromagnetic Cu\noxides may lead to a superconducting state at the interface with minimal\nquenched disorder. Model calculations using static and dynamical mean-field\ntheory, supplemented by a Poisson equation formalism to address charge\nredistribution at the interface, support this view. The magnetic state of the\nmanganites could be antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic. The former is better to\ninduce superconductivity than the latter, since the spin-polarized charge\ntransfer will be detrimental to singlet superconductivity. It is concluded that\nin spite of the robust Hubbard gaps, the electron doping of undoped cuprates at\ninterfaces appears possible, and its realization may open an exciting area of\nresearch in oxide heterostructures.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 07\n"}
