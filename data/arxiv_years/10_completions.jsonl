This wave acts like a highly\ncorrelated local \"boson\" satisfying a modified Cooper problem with additional\ncorrelation stabilization relative to the separate right- and left-handed\ndensity waves composing it. This local \"boson\" could be formed in a two-bound\nroton-like manner; it has Fermion statistics. Delocalized superconductive\npairing (superconductivity) is achieved by a Feshbach resonance of two unpaired\nholes (electrons) resonating with a virtual energy level of the bound pair\nstate of the local \"boson\" as described by the Boson-Fermion-Gossamer (BFG)\nmodel. The spin-charge order interaction offers an explanation for the overall\nshape of the superconducting dome as well a microscopic basis for the cuprate\nsuperconducting transition temperatures. An explanation of the correlation of\nsuperconducting transition temperature with experimental inelastic neutron and\nelectron Raman scattering is proposed, based on the energy of the virtual bound\npair.

We employ stochastic\ndifferential equations and probability distributions obtained from stochastic\nsimulations to characterize differential signaling response in our minimal\nnetwork model. We show that the proposed minimal signaling network displays two\ndistinct types of response as the strength of the stimulus is decreased. The\nsignaling network has a deterministic part that undergoes rapid activation by a\nstrong stimulus in which case cell-to-cell fluctuations can be ignored. As the\nstrength of the stimulus decreases, the stochastic part of the network begins\ndominating the signaling response where slow activation is observed with\ncharacteristic large cell-to-cell stochastic variability. Interestingly, this\nproposed stochastic signaling network can capture some of the essential\nsignaling behaviors of a complex apoptotic cell death signaling network that\nhas been studied through experiments and large-scale computer simulations. Thus\nwe claim that the proposed signaling network is an appropriate minimal model of\napoptosis signaling.

The\nhospital is made up of wards of up to 30 nurses. Each ward has its own group of\nnurses whose shifts have to be scheduled on a weekly basis. In addition to\nfulfilling the minimum demand for staff over three daily shifts, nurses' wishes\nand qualifications have to be taken into account.

The basis of the family of genetic\nalgorithms is a classical genetic algorithm consisting of n-point crossover,\nsingle-bit mutation and a rank-based selection. The solution space consists of\nall schedules in which each nurse works the required number of shifts, but the\nremaining constraints, both hard and soft, are relaxed and penalised in the\nfitness function. The talk will start with a detailed description of the\nproblem and the initial implementation and will go on to highlight the\nshortcomings of such an approach, in terms of the key element of balancing\nfeasibility, i.e. covering the demand and work regulations, and quality, as\nmeasured by the nurses' preferences. A series of experiments involving\nparameter adaptation, niching, intelligent weights, delta coding, local hill\nclimbing, migration and special selection rules will then be outlined and it\nwill be shown how a series of these enhancements were able to eradicate these\ndifficulties. Results based on several months' real data will be used to\nmeasure the impact of each modification, and to show that the final algorithm\nis able to compete with a tabu search approach currently employed at the\nhospital. The talk will conclude with some observations as to the overall\nquality of this approach to this and similar problems.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 13"}

Even if systems with magnetic edge states could be\nmade, the intrinsic magnetism would not be stable at room temperature. Charge\ndoping and the presence of edge defects further destabilize the intrinsic\nmagnetism of such systems.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 08"}

The individual model is given in terms of an Extended Probabilistic\nDiscrete Timed Automaton (EPDTA), a new formalism that is introduced in the\npaper and that is shown to be interpretable as a Markov decision process. A\ngiven EPDTA model can be probabilistically model-checked by giving a suitable\ntranslation into syntax accepted by existing model-checkers. In order to\nsimulate the dynamics of a given population of soles in different environmental\nscenarios, an agent-based simulation environment is defined in which each agent\nimplements the behaviour of the given EPDTA model. By varying the probabilities\nand the characteristic functions embedded in the EPDTA model it is possible to\nrepresent different scenarios and to tune the model itself by comparing the\nresults of the simulations with real data about the sole stock in the North\nAdriatic sea, available from the recent project SoleMon.

To predict time delays and to test\nthe ability of simple mass models to reproduce the observed configuration,\nisothermal and de Vaucouleurs mass models are calculated for the whole sample\nusing state-of-the-art modeling techniques. The effect of the lens environment\non the lens mass models is taken into account with a shear term. Doubly imaged\nquasars are equally well fitted by each of these models. A large amount of\nshear is necessary to reproduce SDSS J1155+6346 and SDSS J1226-006. In the\nlatter case, we identify a nearby galaxy as the dominant source of shear.

A\nnew kind of time-energy performance index is proposed to trade-off time and\nenergy resource cost, in which control magnitudes are optimized in terms of\nthis kind of performance.

{"prompt": "  Model selection in clustering requires (i) to specify a suitable clustering\nprinciple and (ii) to control the model order complexity by choosing an\nappropriate number of clusters depending on the noise level in the data.

A clustering model, which can\ntolerate a higher level of fluctuations in the measurements than alternative\nmodels, is considered to be superior provided that the clustering solution is\nequally informative. This tradeoff between \\emph{informativeness} and\n\\emph{robustness} is used as a model selection criterion.

We introduce\nthe concept of dynamical decoupling pulse-sequence construction as a\nfilter-design problem, making connections with filter design from control\ntheory and electrical engineering in the analysis of pulse-sequence performance\nfor the preservation of the phase degree of freedom in a quantum superposition.\nA detailed mathematical description of how dephasing and the suppression of\ndephasing can be reduced to a linear control problem is provided, and used as\nmotivation and context for studies of the filtration properties of various\ndynamical decoupling sequences.

{"prompt": "  The distributions of the frequencies of the maximum oscillation Power\n({\\nu}_max) and the large frequency separation ( {\\Delta}{\\nu}) of red giant\nstars observed by CoRoT have a dominant peak. Miglio et al. (2009) identified\nthat the stars are red-clump stars. Using stellar population synthesis method,\nwe studied the effects of Reimers mass loss, binary interactions, star\nformation rate and the mixing-length parameter on the distributions of the\n{\\nu}_max and {\\Delta}{\\nu} of red-clump stars. The Reimers mass loss can\nresult in an increase in the {\\nu}_max and {\\Delta}{\\nu} of old population\nwhich lost a considerable amount of mass. However, it leads to a small decrease\nin those of middle-age population which lost a little bit of mass. Furthermore,\na high mass-loss rate impedes the low-mass and low-metal stars evolving into\ncore-helium burning (CHeB) stage. Both Reimers mass loss and star formation\nrate mainly affect the number of CHeB stars with {\\nu}_max and {\\Delta}{\\nu},\nbut hardly affect the peak locations of {\\nu}_max and {\\Delta}{\\nu}. Binary\ninteractions also can lead to an increase or decrease in the {\\nu}_max and\n{\\Delta}{\\nu} of some stars. However, the fraction of CHeB stars undergoing\nbinary interactions is very small in our simulations. Therefore, the peak\nlocations are also not affected by binary interactions. The non-uniform\ndistributions of {\\nu}_max and {\\Delta}{\\nu} are mainly caused by the most of\nred-clump stars having an approximate radius rather than mass. The radius of\nred-clump stars decreases with increasing the mixing-length parameter.
