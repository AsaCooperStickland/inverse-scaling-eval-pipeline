{"prompt": "  Hochster's theta invariant is defined for a pair of finitely generated\nmodules on a hypersurface ring having only an isolated singularity. Up to a\nsign, it agrees with the Euler invariant of a pair of matrix factorizations.\n  Working over the complex numbers, Buchweitz and van Straten have established\nan interesting connection between Hochster's theta invariant and the classical\nlinking form on the link of the singularity. In particular, they establish the\nvanishing of the theta invariant if the hypersurface is even-dimensional by\nexploiting the fact that the (reduced) cohomology of the Milnor fiber is\nconcentrated in odd degrees in this situation.\n  In this paper, we give purely algebraic versions of some of these results.

In this thesis, we resolve a\nmajor part of this issue by describing general techniques that allow to\nquantify the attainable precision in metrological schemes in the presence of\nuncorrelated noise. We show that the abstract geometrical structure of a\nquantum channel describing the noisy evolution of a single particle dictates\nthen critical bounds on the ultimate quantum enhancement. Our results prove\nthat an infinitesimal amount of noise is enough to restrict the precision to\nscale classically in the asymptotic $N$ limit, and thus constrain the maximal\nimprovement to a constant factor.

{"prompt": "  Kepler-78b is a transiting Earth-mass planet in an 8.5 hr orbit discovered by\nthe Kepler Space Mission. We performed an analysis of the published radial\nvelocity measurements for Kepler-78 in order to derive a refined measurement\nfor the planet mass. Kepler-78 is an active star and radial velocity variations\ndue to activity were removed using a Floating Chunk Offset (FCO) method where\nan orbital solution was made to the data by allowing the velocity offsets of\nindividual nights to vary. We show that if we had no a priori knowledge of the\ntransit period the FCO method used as a periodogram would still have detected\nKepler-78b in the radial velocity data. It can thus be effective at finding\nunknown short-period signals in the presence of significant activity noise.\nUsing the FCO method while keeping the ephemeris and orbital phase fixed to the\nphotometric values and using only data from nights where 6-10 measurements were\ntaken results in a K-amplitude of 1.34 +/- 0.25 m/s. a planet mass of 1.31 +/-\n0.24 M_Earth, and a planet density of rho = 4.5 (-2.0/+2.2) g/cm^3. Allowing\nthe orbital phase to be a free parameter reproduces the transit phase to within\nthe uncertainty. The corresponding density implies that Kepler-78b may have a\nstructure that is deficient in iron and is thus more like the Moon. Although\nthe various approaches that were used to filter out the activity of Kepler 78\nproduce consistent radial velocity amplitudes to within the errors, these are\nstill too large to constrain the structure of this planet. The uncertainty in\nthe mass for Kepler-78b is large enough to encompass models with structures\nranging from Mercury-like (iron enriched) to Moon-like (iron deficient). A more\naccurate K-amplitude as well as a better determination of the planet radius are\nneeded to distinguish between these models.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 14\n"}

To complete the model,interaction\nterms between dark energy and dark matter (DM) manually entered in\nphenomenological form. Instead of using the dust model for DM, we have proposed\nDM equivalent to a barotropic fluid. Time evolution of DM is a function of\nother cosmological parameters. Using sophisticated algorithms, the behavior of\nvarious quantities including the densities, Hubble parameter, etc. have been\ninvestigated graphically. The statefinder parameters have been used for the\nclassification of DE models. Consistency of the numerical results with\nexperimental data of $SneIa+BAO+CMB$ are studied by numerical analysis with\nhigh accuracy.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 14\n"}

{"prompt": "  The dynamics of the reaction H + OH $\\to$ O (3P) + H2 have been studied in a\nseries of quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) calculations and transition state\ntheory (TST) methods using high quality 3A' and 3A'' potential energy surfaces\n(PESs). Accurate OH (v, j) state resolved cross sections and rate constants on\nboth potential energy surfaces are presented and fitted for OH at (v = 0, j =\n0-16) and (v = 1, j = 0-6). The cross sections were calculated for different\ncollisional energies (Ec), ranging from the threshold energy at each specific\nrovibrational state up to 1.0 eV with step sizes of 0.1 eV or less. They\nincrease steeply with collision energy when the barrier to reaction can be\novercome, after which the cross sections stay nearly constant with energy.\nState resolved rate constants in the temperature range 200-2500 K are presented\nbased on the cross sections. Total thermal rate constants were calculated by\nsumming the rates for reaction on the 3A' and 3A'' potential energy surfaces\nweighted by 1/3 and taking into account the thermal populations of the\nrovibrational states of the OH molecules. It is shown that the improved\ncanonical variational transition (CVT) treatments with the approximation of\nzero-curvature tunneling (ZCT) or small-curvature tunneling (SCT) produce\nresults more in accord with the QCT results than the TST and CVT methods. The\nreactions are governed by the direct reaction mechanism. The rate constants for\nOH in excited vibrational and rotational states are orders of magnitude larger\nthan the thermal rate constants, which needs to be taken into account in\nastrochemical models.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 14\n"}

This paper seeks to identify weaknesses in the third model,\nas it claims to offer 100% user data confidentiality throughout all data\ntransactions (e.g., upload, download, sharing) through a combination of Network\nTraffic Analysis, Source Code Decompilation, and Source Code Disassembly.

Moreover, velocity-strengthening friction has very\nrecently been linked to slow laboratory earthquakes and stick-slip motion. Here\nwe elucidate the importance of velocity-strengthening friction by theoretically\nstudying three variants of a realistic rate-and-state friction model. All\nvariants feature identical logarithmic velocity-weakening friction at small\nsliding velocities, but differ in their higher velocity behaviors.

We show that they are equivalent to multivariate genetic\nbest linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP), and that they are competitive with\nsingle-trait elastic net and single-trait GBLUP in predictive performance.\nFinally, we discuss their relationship with other additive-effects models and\ntheir advantages in inference and interpretation. MAGIC populations provide an\nideal setting for this kind of investigation because the very low population\nstructure and large sample size result in predictive models with good power and\nlimited confounding due to relatedness.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 14\n"}

The first method relies on mutual planet-moon events during stellar\ntransits. Eclipses with the moon passing behind (in front of) the planet will\nbe late (early) with regard to the moon's mean orbital period due to the finite\nspeed of light. This \"transit timing dichotomy\" (TTD) determines an exomoon's\nSOM with respect to the circumstellar motion. For the ten largest moons in the\nsolar system, TTDs range between 2 and 12 s. The E-ELT will enable such\nmeasurements for Earth-sized moons around nearby stars.

This Rossiter-McLaughlin effect (RME) in the planetary\nspectrum reveals the angle between the planetary equator and the moon's\ncircumplanetary orbital plane, and therefore unveils the moon's SOM with\nrespect to the planet's rotation.

{"prompt": "  Controlling complex networked systems to a desired state is a key research\ngoal in contemporary science. Despite recent advances in studying the impact of\nnetwork topology on controllability, a comprehensive understanding of the\nsynergistic effect of network topology and individual dynamics on\ncontrollability is still lacking. Here we offer a theoretical study with\nparticular interest in the diversity of dynamic units characterized by\ndifferent types of individual dynamics. Interestingly, we find a global\nsymmetry accounting for the invariance of controllability with respect to\nexchanging the densities of any two different types of dynamic units,\nirrespective of the network topology. The highest controllability arises at the\nglobal symmetry point, at which different types of dynamic units are of the\nsame density. The lowest controllability occurs when all self-loops are either\ncompletely absent or present with identical weights.

Effective temperatures for our targets are determined from all\nwell-sampled observing epochs and are based on a V-I_C color-index calibration.\nThe effective temperature change between the extrema of the rotational\nmodulation for IL Hya and XX Tri is in the range 50-200 K. The bolometric flux\nduring maximum of the rotational modulation, i.e., the least spotted states,\nvaried by up to 39% in IL Hya and up to 54% in XX Tri over the course of our\nobservations. We emphasize that for IL Hya this is just about half of the total\nluminosity variation that can be explained by the photospheric temperature\n(spots/faculae) changes, while for XX Tri it is even about one third. The\nlong-term, 0.6 mag V-band variation of DM UMa is more difficult to explain\nbecause little or no B-V color index change is observed on the same timescale.\nPlacing the three stars with their light and color variations into H-R\ndiagrams, we find that their overall luminosities are generally too low\ncompared to predictions from current evolutionary tracks. A change in the\nstellar radius due to strong and variable magnetic fields during activity\ncycles likely plays a role in explaining the anomalous brightness and\nluminosity of our three targets. At least for IL Hya, a radius change of about\n9% is suggested from m_bol and T_eff, and is supported by independent vsin(i)\nmeasurements.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 14\n"}

The preferred chirality\nmay then be chosen by the direction of the current flow. Both, the suppression\nof the Walker breakdown and the chirality switching, affect the domain wall\nvelocity.

The\nmost widely used approach to this problem is to convert strings into numerical\nvectors using string kernels and subsequently apply a support vector machine\nthat works in a numerical vector space. However, this non-one-to-one conversion\ninvolves a loss of information and makes it impossible to evaluate, using\nprobability theory, the generalization error of a learning machine, considering\nthat the given data to train and test the machine are strings generated\naccording to probability laws. In this study, we approach this classification\nproblem by constructing a classifier that works in a set of strings.

The perturbative soft initial\nstate radiation (ISR) has a contribution that depends on the jet area in the\nsame way as the underlying event, but this degeneracy is broken by dependence\non the jet $p_T$. The size of this soft ISR contribution is proportional to the\ncolor state of the initial partons, yielding the same positive contribution for\n$gg\\to Hg$ and $gq\\to Zq$, but a negative interference contribution for $q\\bar\nq\\to Z g$. Hence, measuring these dependencies allows one to separate\nhadronization, soft ISR, and MPI contributions in the data.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 14\n"}

Other physical estimates of the extent of gravitational\ninfluence include the gravitational radius, gas accretion radius, and\n\"galactopause\" arising from outflows that stall at 100-200 kpc over a range of\noutflow parameters and confining gas pressures. Physical criteria are proposed\nto define bound structures, including a more realistic definition of R_vir (M*,\nM_h, z_a) for stellar mass M* and halo mass M_h, half of which formed at\n\"assembly redshifts\" z_a = 0.7-1.3. We estimate the extent of bound gas and\ndark matter around L* galaxies to be ~200 kpc. The new virial radii, with mean\nR_vir ~ 200 kpc, are 40-50% smaller than values estimated in recent HST/COS\ndetections of H I and O VI absorbers around galaxies. In the new formalism, the\nMilky Way stellar mass, log M* = 10.7 +/- 0.1, would correspond to R_vir = 153\n(+25,-16) kpc for half-mass halo assembly at z_a = 1.06 +/- 0.03.

We demonstrate that the-third-way results from the\ntemperature-fluctuation-induced dynamical charge redistribution. It is a\nconsequence of the fundamental nonequilibrium thermodynamics and has a deep\nconnection to the topological phase in quantum mechanics.

The presence of the BD scalar field comes up with some\nmodification terms in the Friedmann equation. Since the behavior of phase\ntransition strongly depends on the basic evolution equations, even a small\nchange in these relations might come to interesting results about the time of\ntransition. The phase transition is investigated using two scenarios of the\nfirst-order phase transition and smooth crossover phase transition. For\nfirst-order scenario, which is used for intermediate temperature regime, the\nevolution of the physical quantities, such as temperature and scale factor, are\ninvestigated before, during and after the phase transition. The results show\nthat the transition occurs in about micro-second. In the next part, the\nphenomenon is studied by assuming a smooth crossover transition where the\nlattice QCD data is utilized to obtain a realistic equation of state for the\nmatter. The investigation for this part is performed in two regimes of high and\nlow-temperature. Using trace anomaly in the high-temperature regime specifies a\nsimple equation of state which states that the quark-gluon behaves like\nradiation. However, in the low-temperature regime, the trace anomaly is\naffected by discretization effects, and the hadron resonance gas model is\nutilized instead. Using this model, a more realistic equation of state could be\nfound in the low-temperature regime. The crossover phase transition in both\nregimes is considered. The results determine that the transition occurs at the\ntime around a few micro-second.

{"prompt": "  We propose and analyze a circuit that implements a nonlinear coupling between\ntwo superconducting microwave resonators. The resonators are coupled through a\nsuperconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) that terminates one of the\nresonators. This produces a nonlinear interaction on the standard\noptomechanical form, where the quadrature of one resonator couples to the\nphoton number of the other resonator. The circuit therefore allows for\nall-electrical realizations of analogs to optomechanical systems, with coupling\nthat can be both strong and tunable. We estimate the coupling strengths that\nshould be attainable with the proposed device, and we find that the device is a\npromising candidate for realizing the single-photon strong-coupling regime. As\na potential application, we discuss implementations of networks of\nnonlinearly-coupled microwave resonators, which could be used in\nmicrowave-photon based quantum simulation.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 14\n"}

{"prompt": "  We develop a detailed rigorous analysis of edge bifurcations of standing\nwaves in the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (NLS) equation on a tadpole graph (a ring\nattached to a semi-infinite line subject to the Kirchhoff boundary conditions\nat the junction). It is shown in the recent work [7] by using explicit Jacobi\nelliptic functions that the cubic NLS equation on a tadpole graph admits a rich\nstructure of standing waves. Among these, there are different branches of\nlocalized waves bifurcating from the edge of the essential spectrum of an\nassociated Schr\\\"odinger operator. We show by using a modified Lyapunov-Schmidt\nreduction method that the bifur- cation of localized standing waves occurs for\nevery positive power nonlinearity. We distinguish a primary branch of never\nvanishing standing waves bifurcating from the trivial solution and an infinite\nsequence of higher branches with oscillating behavior in the ring. The higher\nbranches bifurcate from the branches of degenerate standing waves with\nvanishing tail outside the ring. Moreover, we analyze stability of bifurcating\nstanding waves. Namely, we show that the primary branch is composed by\norbitally stable standing waves for subcritical power nonlinearities, while all\nnontrivial higher branches are linearly unstable near the bifurcation point.\nThe stability character of the degenerate branches remains inconclusive at the\nanalytical level, whereas heuristic arguments based on analysis of embedded\neigenvalues of negative Krein signatures support the conjecture of their linear\ninstability at least near the bifurcation point. Numerical results for the\ncubic NLS equation show that this conjecture is valid and that the degenerate\nbranches become spectrally stable far away from the bifurcation point.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 14\n"}

This\nproblem is compounded by the fact that state-of-the-art assemblers do not build\nthe de Bruijn graph for a single order (value of $K$) but for multiple values\nof $K$.

For electromagnetic relativistic beam and plasma modeling, the most\nrelevant numerical instabilities are the finite grid instability and the\nnumerical Cherenkov instability. We review the numerical dispersion relation of\nthe electromagnetic PIC algorithm to analyze the origin of these instabilities.\nWe rigorously derive the faithful 3D numerical dispersion of the PIC algorithm,\nand then specialize to the Yee FDTD scheme. In particular, we account for the\nmanner in which the PIC algorithm updates and samples the fields and\ndistribution function. Temporal and spatial phase factors from solving\nMaxwell's equations on the Yee grid with the leapfrog scheme are also\nexplicitly accounted for. Numerical solutions to the electrostatic-like modes\nin the 1D dispersion relation for a cold drifting plasma are obtained for\nparameters of interest. In the succeeding analysis, we investigate how the\nfinite grid instability arises from the interaction of the numerical 1D modes\nadmitted in the system and their aliases. The most significant interaction is\ndue critically to the correct represenation of the operators in the dispersion\nrelation.

There is a trend that the\nLAEs with a large Lya EW have a small ellipticity.

Collaboration, Carina and Sculptor, are presented. In\nthe absence of a significant signal new constraints on the annihilation\ncross-section applicable to Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are\nderived by combining the observations of the five dwarf galaxies. The combined\nexclusion limit depends on the WIMP mass and the best constraint is reached at\n1-2 TeV masses with a cross-section upper bound of ~3.9x10-24 cm^3 s-1 at a 95%\nconfidence level.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 14\n"}

These\nalgorithms are designed for very sparse networks and do not work well when the\ndegrees of the nodes are relatively larger. For networks with larger degrees,\nMap-Reduce based algorithm generates prohibitively large intermediate data, and\nin MPI based algorithms with overlapping partitions, each partition can grow as\nlarge as the original network, wiping out the benefit of partitioning the\nnetwork.\n  In this paper, we present two efficient MPI-based parallel algorithms for\ncounting triangles in massive networks with large degrees.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We formulate a\n(non-Bayesian) model for revising subjective probabilistic opinion of a\nconfirmationally-biased agent in the light of a persuasive opinion. The\nrevision rule ensures that the agent does not react to persuasion that is\neither far from his current opinion or coincides with it. We demonstrate that\nthe model accounts for the basic phenomenology of the social judgment theory,\nand allows to study various phenomena such as cognitive dissonance and\nboomerang effect. The model also displays the order of presentation effect|when\nconsecutively exposed to two opinions, the preference is given to the last\nopinion (recency) or the first opinion (primacy)|and relates recency to\nconfirmation bias.

We show that the kernel of the induced mixture model for\nthe observed data is identifiable upon a restriction on the latent variables.\nTo allow for appropriate dependence structure while facilitating\nidentifiability, we use a square-root-free Cholesky decomposition of the\ncovariance matrix in the normal mixture kernel. In addition to allowing for the\nnecessary restriction, this modeling strategy provides substantial\nsimplifications in implementation of Markov chain Monte Carlo posterior\nsimulation. We present two data examples taken from areas for which the\nmethodology is especially well suited. In particular, the first example\ninvolves estimation of relationships between environmental variables, and the\nsecond develops inference for natural selection surfaces in evolutionary\nbiology.

{"prompt": "  We study the thermal structure of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) in a set of\ncosmological hydrodynamical cluster simulations performed with an SPH numerical\nscheme employing an artificial conductivity (AC) term. We explore the effects\nof this term on the ICM temperature and entropy profiles, thermal distribution,\nvelocity field and expected X-ray emission. We find that in adiabatic runs the\nartificial conductivity favours (i) the formation of an entropy core, raising\nand flattening the central entropy profiles, in better agreement with findings\nfrom Eulerian codes; and (ii) a systematic reduction of the cold gas component.\nIn fact, the cluster large-scale structure and dynamical state are preserved\nacross different runs, but the improved gas mixing enabled by the AC term\nstrongly increases the stripping rate of gas from the cold clumps moving\nthrough the ICM. This in turn reduces the production of turbulence generated by\nthe instabilities which develop because of the interaction between clumps and\nambient ICM. We then find that turbulent motions, enhanced by the\ntime-dependent artificial viscosity scheme we use, are rather damped by the AC\nterm. The ICM synthetic X-ray emission substantially mirrors the changes in its\nthermo-dynamical structure, stressing the robustness of the AC impact. All\nthese effects are softened by the introduction of radiative cooling but still\npresent, especially a partial suppression of cold gas. Therefore, not only the\nphysics accounted for, but also the numerical approach itself can have an\nimpact in shaping the ICM thermo-dynamical structure and ultimately in the use\nof SPH cluster simulations for cosmological studies.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 14\n"}

As of today, existing algorithms\nto identify nodes with high centrality measures operate upon the entire (or\nrather global) network, resulting in high computational complexity. In this\npaper, we design efficient algorithms for determining the betweenness\ncentrality in large scale networks by taking advantage of the modular topology\nexhibited by most of these large scale networks. Very briefly, modular\ntopologies are those wherein the entire network appears partitioned into\ndistinct modules (or clusters or communities), wherein nodes within the module\n(that likely share highly similar profiles) have dense connections between\nthem, while connections across modules are relatively sparse.

In particular we define an\nentropy per tooth in analogy with the entropy per carrier or Seebeck\ncoefficient, and we derive the analogue to Kelvin's second relation for\nFeynman's ratchet. Owing to the formal similarity between the heat fluxes\nbalance equations for a thermoelectric generator (TEG) and those for Feynman's\nratchet, we introduce a distribution parameter that quantifies the amount of\nheat that flows through the cold and hot sides of both heat engines. While it\nis well established that $\\gamma$ = 1/2 for a TEG, it is equal to 1 for\nFeynman's ratchet. This implies that no heat may be rejected in the cold\nreservoir for the latter case.

Second, we define the\ndiversity-discrimination tradeoff which, by analogy with the\ndiversity-multiplexing tradeoff of fading vector channels, characterizes\nrelationships between the number of discernible subspaces and the\nmisclassification probability as the noise power approaches zero. We derive\nupper and lower bounds on these measures which are tight in many regimes.\nNumerical results, including a face recognition application, validate the\nresults in practice.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 14\n"}

{"prompt": "  We present a novel method for revealing the equation of state of high-density\nneutron star matter through gravitational waves emitted during the postmerger\nphase of a binary neutron star system. The method relies on a small number of\ndetections of the peak frequency in the postmerger phase for binaries of\ndifferent (relatively low) masses, in the most likely range of expected\ndetections. From such observations, one can construct the derivative of the\npeak frequency versus the binary mass, in this mass range. Through a detailed\nstudy of binary neutron star mergers for a large sample of equations of state,\nwe show that one can extrapolate the above information to the highest possible\nmass (the threshold mass for black hole formation in a binary neutron star\nmerger). In turn, this allows for an empirical determination of the maximum\nmass of cold, nonrotating neutron stars to within 0.1 M_sun, while the\ncorresponding radius is determined to within a few percent. Combining this with\nthe determination of the radius of cold, nonrotating neutron stars of 1.6 M_sun\n(to within a few percent, as was demonstrated in Bauswein et al., PRD, 86,\n063001, 2012), allows for a clear distinction of a particular candidate\nequation of state among a large set of other candidates. Our method is\nparticularly appealing because it reveals simultaneously the moderate and very\nhigh-density parts of the equation of state, enabling the distinction of\nmass-radius relations even if they are similar at typical neutron star masses.\nFurthermore, our method also allows to deduce the maximum central energy\ndensity and maximum central rest-mass density of cold, nonrotating neutron\nstars with an accuracy of a few per cent.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 14\n"}

{"prompt": "  Over the last thirty years, numerous consistency conditions for replicated\ndata have been proposed and implemented. Popular examples of such conditions\ninclude linearizability (or atomicity), sequential consistency, causal\nconsistency, and eventual consistency. These consistency conditions are usually\ndefined independently from the computing entities (nodes) that manipulate the\nreplicated data; i.e., they do not take into account how computing entities\nmight be linked to one another, or geographically distributed. To address this\nlack, as a first contribution, this paper introduces the notion of proximity\ngraph between computing nodes. If two nodes are connected in this graph, their\noperations must satisfy a strong consistency condition, while the operations\ninvoked by other nodes are allowed to satisfy a weaker condition. The second\ncontribution is the use of such a graph to provide a generic approach to the\nhybridization of data consistency conditions into the same system. We\nillustrate this approach on sequential consistency and causal consistency, and\npresent a model in which all data operations are causally consistent, while\noperations by neighboring processes in the proximity graph are sequentially\nconsistent. The third contribution of the paper is the design and the proof of\na distributed algorithm based on this proximity graph, which combines\nsequential consistency and causal consistency (the resulting condition is\ncalled fisheye consistency). In doing so the paper not only extends the domain\nof consistency conditions, but provides a generic provably correct solution of\ndirect relevance to modern georeplicated systems.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 14\n"}

Specifically, our approach, Learning TO Diversify\nvia Weighted Kernels (L2DWK), performs classifier combination by optimizing a\ndirect but simple criterion: maximizing ensemble accuracy and adaptive\ndiversity simultaneously by minimizing a convex loss function. Given a measure\nformulation, the diversity is calculated with weighted kernels (i.e., the\ndiversity is measured on the component classifiers' outputs which are kernelled\nand weighted), and the kernel weights are automatically learned. We minimize\nthis loss function by estimating the kernel weights in conjunction with the\nclassifier weights, and propose a self-training algorithm for conducting this\nconvex optimization procedure iteratively.

We therefore explore the energetic properties of\nmicroflares by combining Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray measurements.\n  We present forward-fitting differential emission measure (DEM) analysis of 10\nmicroflares. The fitting is constrained by combining, for the first time, high\ntemperature RHESSI observations and flux data from SDO/AIA. Two fitting models\nare tested for the DEM; a Gaussian distribution and a uniform DEM profile. A\nGaussian fit proved unable to explain the observations for any of the studied\nmicroflares.

This redundancy can also be used for extending the lifetime of the\nnetwork, if a proper scheduling mechanism is available for scheduling the\nactive and sleep times of sensor nodes in such a way that each node is in\nactive mode only if it is required to. In this pa-per, we propose an efficient\nscheduling method based on learning automata and we called it LAML, in which\neach node is equipped with a learning automaton, which helps the node to select\nits proper state (active or sleep), at any given time. To study the performance\nof the proposed method, computer simulations are conducted.

Two similar models\nhave been proposed, one by Di\\'osi [D-model] and one by Karolyhazy and\ncollaborators [K-model], based on apparently unrelated minimal spacetime\nbounds. The two models arrive at somewhat different expressions for the\ndependence of the localization coherence length on the mass and size of the\nquantum object. In the present article we compare and contrast the two models\nfrom three aspects: (i) comparison of the spacetime bounds, (ii) method of\ncalculating decoherence time, (iii) comparison of noise correlation. We show\nthat under certain conditions the minimal spacetime bounds in the two models\ncan be derived one from the other. We argue that the methods of calculating the\ndecoherence time are equivalent. We re-derive the two-point correlation for the\nfluctuation potential in the K-model, and confirm the earlier result of Di\\'osi\nand Luk\\'acs that it is non-white noise, unlike in the D-model, where the\ncorresponding correlation is white noise in time. This seems to be the origin\nof the different results in the two models. We derive the non-Markovian master\nequation for the K-model. We argue that the minimal spacetime bound cannot\npredict the noise correlation uniquely, and additional criteria are necessary\nto accurately determine the effects of gravitationally induced decoherence.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 14\n"}

{"prompt": "  The main objective of this paper is to present a mechanism of enhanced paging\nsupport for the second generation microkernels in the form of explicit support\nof multi-pager environment for the tasks running in the system. Proposed\nmechanism is based on the intra-kernel high granularity pagers assignments per\nvirtual address space, which allow efficient and simple dispatching of page\nfaults to the appropriate pagers. The paging is one of the major features of\nthe virtual memory, which is extensively used by advanced operating systems to\nprovide an illusion of elastic memory. Original and present second generation\nmicrokernels provide only limited, inflexible and unnatural support for paging.\nFurthermore, facilities provided by current solutions for multi-pager support\non the runtime level introduce an overhead in terms of mode switches and thread\ncontext switches which can be significantly reduced. Limited paging support\nlimits the attractiveness of the second generation microkernel based systems\nuse in real-life applications, in which processes usually have concurrent\nservicing of multiple paging servers. The purpose of this paper is to present a\nfacilities for the efficient and flexible support of multi-pager environments\nfor the second generation microkernels. A comparison of the proposed solution\nto the present architecture L4 + L4Re has been made and overhead of the page\nfault handling critical path has been evaluated.

We\nargue that magnetic field decay builds up stresses in a neutron star's crust,\nas the elastic shear force resists the Lorentz force's desire to rearrange the\nglobal magnetic-field equilibrium. We derive a criterion for crust-breaking\ninduced by a changing magnetic-field configuration, and use this to investigate\nstrain patterns in a neutron star's crust for a variety of different\nmagnetic-field models. Universally, we find that the crust is most liable to\nbreak if the magnetic field has a strong toroidal component, in which case the\nepicentre of the crustquake is around the equator. We calculate the energy\nreleased in a crustquake as a function of the fracture depth, finding that it\nis independent of field strength.

{"prompt": "  Online algorithms are usually analyzed using the notion of competitive ratio\nwhich compares the solution obtained by the algorithm to that obtained by an\nonline adversary for the worst possible input sequence. Often this measure\nturns out to be too pessimistic, and one popular approach especially for\nscheduling problems has been that of \"resource augmentation\" which was first\nproposed by Kalyanasundaram and Pruhs. Although resource augmentation has been\nvery successful in dealing with a variety of objective functions, there are\nproblems for which even a (arbitrary) constant speedup cannot lead to a\nconstant competitive algorithm. In this paper we propose a \"rejection model\"\nwhich requires no resource augmentation but which permits the online algorithm\nto not serve an epsilon-fraction of the requests.\n  The problems considered in this paper are in the restricted assignment\nsetting where each job can be assigned only to a subset of machines. For the\nload balancing problem where the objective is to minimize the maximum load on\nany machine, we give $O(\\log^2 1/\\eps)$-competitive algorithm which rejects at\nmost an $\\eps$-fraction of the jobs. For the problem of minimizing the maximum\nweighted flow-time, we give an $O(1/\\eps^4)$-competitive algorithm which can\nreject at most an $\\eps$-fraction of the jobs by weight. We also extend this\nresult to a more general setting where the weights of a job for measuring its\nweighted flow-time and its contribution towards total allowed rejection weight\nare different.

The reason for the turbulence-enabled disk formation is\nusually attributed to the turbulence-induced magnetic reconnection, which is\nthought to reduce the magnetic flux accumulated in the disk-forming region. We\nadvance an alternative interpretation, based on magnetic decoupling-triggered\nreconnection of severely pinched field lines close to the central protostar and\nturbulence-induced warping of the pseudodisk of Galli and Shu. Such\nreconnection weakens the central split magnetic monopole that lies at the heart\nof the magnetic braking catastrophe under flux freezing. We show, through\nidealized numerical experiments, that the pseudodisk can be strongly warped,\nbut not completely destroyed, by a subsonic or sonic turbulence. The warping\ndecreases the rates of angular momentum removal from the pseudodisk by both\nmagnetic torque and outflow, making it easier to form a rotationally supported\ndisk. More importantly, the warping of the pseudodisk out of the disk-forming,\nequatorial plane greatly reduces the amount of magnetic flux threading the\ncircumstellar, disk-forming region, further promoting disk formation. The\nbeneficial effects of pseudodisk warping can also be achieved by a misalignment\nbetween the magnetic field and rotation axis.

The proposed installation is a large array of compound eye\nstations of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov and fluorescence detectors, with wide\nfield of view and refined observational ability of air showers from cosmic tau\nneutrinos in the PeV-EeV energy range. This advanced optical complex system is\nbased substantially on the development of All-sky Survey High Resolution\nAir-shower detector (Ashra) and applies the tau shower Earth-skimming method to\nsurvey PeV-EeV tau neutrinos.

For two lattices\nconnected by a junction, we find that the current and particle number\nfluctuations from the microcanonical approach compare well with the values\npredicted by the Landauer formalism and FCS assuming a binomial distribution.\nHowever, we demonstrate that well-defined reservoirs (i.e., particles in\nFermi-Dirac distributions) are not present for a substantial duration of the\nquasi-steady state. Thus, the Landauer assumption of reservoirs and/or\ninelastic effects is not necessary for establishing a quasi-steady state.\nMaintaining such a state indefinitely requires an infinite system, and in this\nlimit well-defined Fermi-Dirac distributions can occur. A Kubo approach -- in\nthe spirit of the microcanonical picture -- bridges the gap between the two\nformalisms, giving explicit analytical expressions for the formation of the\nsteady state.

Our observations find no convincing underlying quiescent sources\ncoincident with the locations of these transients, allowing us to rule out a\nnumber of potential progenitor systems. The presence of surviving massive-star\nbinary companions (or other cluster members) are ruled out, providing an\nindependent rejection of a massive star origin for these events.

Given the lack of\nunderlying systems, previous progenitor suggestions have difficulty reproducing\nthe remote locations of these transients, even when considering solely\nhalo-borne progenitors. Our preferred scenario is that calcium-rich transients\nare high velocity, kicked systems, exploding at large distances from their\nnatal site.

Locally, the species emerge, interact\nand go extinct according to the rules of the well-known evolutionary food web\nmodel proposed by Loeuille and Loreau in 2005. Additionally, species are able\nto migrate between the habitats. With random migration, we are able to\nreproduce common trends in diversity-dispersal relationships: Regional\ndiversity decreases with increasing migration rates, whereas local diversity\ncan increase in case of a low level of dispersal. Moreover, we find that the\ntotal biomasses in the different patches become similar even when species\ncomposition remains different. With adaptive migration, we observe species\ncompositions that differ considerably between patches and contain species that\nare descendant from ancestors on both patches.

This, in\nparticular, allows to improve the bound for the number of independent equations\nwith maximal rank from quadratic to linear.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 14\n"}
{"prompt": "  Accurate prediction of chemical and material properties from first principles\nquantum chemistry is a challenging task on traditional computers. Recent\ndevelopments in quantum computation offer a route towards highly accurate\nsolutions with polynomial cost, however this solution still carries a large\noverhead. In this perspective, we aim to bring together known results about the\nlocality of physical interactions from quantum chemistry with ideas from\nquantum computation. We show that the utilization of spatial locality combined\nwith the Bravyi-Kitaev transformation offers an improvement in the scaling of\nknown quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry and provide numerical examples\nto help illustrate this point. We combine these developments to improve the\noutlook for the future of quantum chemistry on quantum computers.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 14\n"}
{"prompt": "  We introduce the basic concepts of catastrophe theory needed to derive\nanalytically the phase diagram of the proton-neutron interacting boson model\n(IBM-2). Previous studies [1,2,3] were based on numerical solutions. We here\nexplain the whole IBM-2 phase diagram including the precise order of the phase\ntransitions in terms of the cusp catastrophe.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 14\n"}

{"prompt": "  The spectrum of terahertz (THz) emission in gases via ionizing two-color\nfemtosecond pulses is analyzed by means of a semi-analytic model and\nfinite-difference-time-domain simulations in 1D and 2D geometries. We show that\nproduced THz signals interact with free electron trajectories and thus\ninfluence significantly further THz generation upon propagation, i.e., make the\nprocess inherently nonlocal. This self-action plays a key role in the observed\nstrong spectral broadening of the generated THz field. Diffraction limits the\nachievable THz bandwidth by efficiently depleting the low frequency amplitudes\nin the propagating field.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 14\n"}
{"prompt": "  We demonstrate a novel detection method for the cyclotron resonance frequency\nof an electron plasma in a Penning-Malmberg trap. With this technique, the\nelectron plasma is used as an in situ diagnostic tool for measurement of the\nstatic magnetic field and the microwave electric field in the trap. The\ncyclotron motion of the electron plasma is excited by microwave radiation and\nthe temperature change of the plasma is measured non-destructively by\nmonitoring the plasma's quadrupole mode frequency. The spatially-resolved\nmicrowave electric field strength can be inferred from the plasma temperature\nchange and the magnetic field is found through the cyclotron resonance\nfrequency. These measurements were used extensively in the recently reported\ndemonstration of resonant quantum interactions with antihydrogen.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 14\n"}
{"prompt": "  A new iteration method is proposed for analyzing both the multiplicities and\nthe transverse momentum spectra measured only within a small rapidity interval\nand with low momentum limit without any inconsistency or ad hoc assumptions and\napplied to the hadron data by the ALICE collaboration in Pb+Pb collisions at\n2.76 TeV/A. In order to correctly consider the resonance contribution only to\nthe small rapidity interval, ratios involving only those hadrons whose\ntransverse momentum spectrum is available are considered. In spite of the small\nnumber of ratios considered, the fittings of both the ratios the transverse\nmomentum spectra are excellent. Also the calculated ratios involving strange\nbaryons with parameters obtained agree with data surprisingly well.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 14\n"}
