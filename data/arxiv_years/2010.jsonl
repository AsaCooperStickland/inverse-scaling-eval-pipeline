The line\nshapes of the absorption spectra are the same in all the films and indicate\nthat the Co$^{2+}$ ions substitute for the Zn sites. The magnetic-field and\ntemperature dependences of the XMCD intensity are consistent with the\nmagnetization measurements, indicating that except for Co there are no\nadditional sources for the magnetic moment, and demonstrate the coexistence of\nparamagnetic and ferromagnetic components in the homo-epitaxial\nZn$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$O thin films, in contrast to the ferromagnetism in the\nhetero-epitaxial Zn$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$O films studied previously. The analysis of\nthe XMCD intensities using the Curie-Weiss law reveals the presence of\nantiferromagnetic interaction between the paramagnetic Co ions. Missing XMCD\nintensities and magnetization signals indicate that most of Co ions are\nnon-magnetic probably because they are strongly coupled antiferromagnetically\nwith each other. Annealing in a high vacuum reduces both the paramagnetic and\nferromagnetic signals. We attribute the reductions to thermal diffusion and\naggregation of Co ions with antiferromagnetic nanoclusters in\nZn$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$O.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2010"}

For the first time we\nquantified, via the \"locally optimally emitting cloud\" model, the contribution\nof the broad line region (BLR) to the absolute luminosity of the broad\ncomponent of the Fe K alpha at 6.4 keV. We find that the contribution of the\nBLR is only ~3%. In the two-line component scenario, we also evaluated the\ncontribution of the highly ionized gas component, which produces the FeXXVI\nline in the iron K region. This contribution to the narrow core of the Fe K\nalpha line is marginal <0.1%. Most of the luminosity of the unresolved,\ncomponent of Fe K alpha may come from the obscuring torus, while the very-broad\nassociated component may come from the accretion disk.

The 24um Spitzer\nimages reveal that while the IRDCs remain dark, many of the cores are\nassociated with bright 24um emission sources, which suggests that they contain\none or more embedded protostars. Combining the 24um, 60-100um, and\nsub-millimeter continuum data, we have constructed broadband spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) for 157 of the cores within these IRDCs and, using simple\ngray-body fits to the SEDs, have estimated their dust temperatures,\nemissivities, opacities, bolometric luminosities, masses and densities.

The active `protostellar' cores typically have\nwarmer dust temperatures and higher bolometric luminosities than the more\nquiescent, perhaps `pre-protostellar', cores.

As a result, there has been a significant effort in developing\ntime-averaged and spatially-filtered equations for large scale dynamics from\nthe fully resolved governing differential equations. One should realize that by\nstarting from these fully-resolved equations (e.g. the Euler or Navier-Stokes\nequations) to derive an averaged evolution equation one has already taken the\nlimit of the wave-numbers approaching infinity with no regards to our\nobservational abilities at such a limit. As a result, obtaining the evolution\nequations for large scale quantities (low wave-numbers) by an averaging or\nfiltering process is done after the fact. This could explain many of the\ntheoretical and computational difficulties with the Euler or Navier-Stokes\nequations. Here, a rather different approach is proposed.

A new observable divergence concept is defined based on fluxes\ncalculated from observable quantities at a desired averaging scale, $\\alpha$.\nAn observable divergence theorem is then proved and applied in the derivation\nof the observable and regularized transport equations.

{"prompt": "  Optomechanical systems are a promising candidate for the implementation of\nquantum interfaces for storing and redistributing quantum information. Here we\nfocus on the case of a high-finesse optical cavity with a thin vibrating\nsemitransparent membrane in the middle. We show that robust and stationary\noptomechanical entanglement could be achieved in the system, even in the\npresence of nonnegligible optical absorption in the membrane. We also present\nsome preliminary experimental data showing radiation-pressure induced optical\nbistability.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2010"}
