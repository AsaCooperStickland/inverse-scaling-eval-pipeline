{"prompt": "  We conducted an empirical analysis into the relation between control and\ndiscourse structure. We applied control criteria to four dialogues and\nidentified 3 levels of discourse structure. We investigated the mechanism for\nchanging control between these structures and found that utterance type and not\ncue words predicted shifts of control. Participants used certain types of\nsignals when discourse goals were proceeding successfully but resorted to\ninterruptions when they were not.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20cm"}
