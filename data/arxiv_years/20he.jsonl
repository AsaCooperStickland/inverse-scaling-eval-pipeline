{"prompt": "  As a further elaboration of the proposal of Ref. [1] we address the\nconstruction of Standard-like models from configurations of stacks of\norientifold planes and D-branes on an internal space with the structure\n${(Gepner model)^{c=6} \\times T^2}/Z_N$. As a first step, the construction of\nD=6 Type II B orientifolds on Gepner points, in the diagonal invariant case and\nfor both, odd and even, affine levels is discussed. We build up the explicit\nexpressions for B-type boundary states and crosscaps and obtain the amplitudes\namong them. From such amplitudes we read the corresponding spectra and the\ntadpole cancellation equations. Further compactification on a T^2 torus, by\nsimultaneously orbifolding the Gepner and the torus internal sectors, is\nperformed. The embedding of the orbifold action in the brane sector breaks the\noriginal gauge groups and leads to N=1 supersymmetric chiral spectra. Whenever\neven orbifold action on the torus is considered, new branes, with worldvolume\ntransverse to torus coordinates, must be included. The detailed rules for\nobtaining the D=4 model spectra and tadpole equations are shown. As an\nillustration we present a 3 generations Left-Right symmetric model that can be\nfurther broken to a MSSM model.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20he"}

{"prompt": "  We use the Kontsevich-Miwa transform to relate the different pictures\ndescribing matter coupled to topological gravity in two dimensions: topological\ntheories, Virasoro constraints on integrable hierarchies, and a DDK-type\nformalism. With the help of the Kontsevich-Miwa transform, we solve the\nVirasoro constraints on the KP hierarchy in terms of minimal models dressed\nwith a (free) Liouville-like scalar. The dressing prescription originates in a\ntopological (twisted N=2) theory. The Virasoro constraints are thus related to\nessentially the N=2 null state decoupling equations. The N=2 generators are\nconstructed out of matter, the `Liouville' scalar, and $c=-2$ ghosts. By a\n`dual' construction involving the reparametrization $c=-26$ ghosts, the DDK\ndressing prescription is reproduced from the N=2 symmetry.
