{"prompt": "  The conventional design of cellular systems prescribes the separation of\nuplink and downlink transmissions via time-division or frequency-division\nduplex. Recent advances in analog and digital domain self-interference\ninterference cancellation challenge the need for this arrangement and open up\nthe possibility to operate base stations, especially low-power ones, in a\nfull-duplex mode. As a means to cope with the resulting downlink-to-uplink\ninterference among base stations, this letter investigates the impact of the\nCloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) architecture. The analysis follows an\ninformation theoretic approach based on the classical Wyner model. The\nanalytical results herein confirm the significant potential advantages of the\nC-RAN architecture in the presence of full-duplex base stations, as long as\nsufficient fronthaul capacity is available and appropriate mobile station\nscheduling, or successive interference cancellation at the mobile stations, is\nimplemented.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2014"}

Using the\neigenbasis of the non-interacting system I show that, provided the interactions\nare local and do not result in a closing of the gap, then even and odd parity\nsectors are unitarily equivalent. Following on from this, it is possible to\ndefine two many-body operators that connect each state in one sector with a\ndegenerate counterpart in the sector with opposite parity. This result applies\nto all states in the system and therefore establishes, for a long enough wire,\nthat all even-odd eigenpairs remain essentially degenerate in the presence of\nlocal interactions.

Radio AGN are an order of magnitude more common\nin early-type galaxies (ETGs) than in their late-type counterparts. The\nVLBI-detected ETGs in this study have a similar stellar mass distribution to\ntheir undetected counterparts, are typically not the central galaxies of\nclusters and exhibit merger fractions that are significantly higher than in the\naverage ETG. This suggests that these radio AGN (which have VLBI luminosities\n>10^22 W Hz^-1) are primarily fuelled by mergers, and not by internal stellar\nmass loss or cooling flows. Our radio AGN are a factor of ~3 times more likely\nto reside in the UV-optical red sequence than the average ETG. Furthermore,\ntypical AGN lifetimes (a few 10^7 yr) are much shorter than the transit times\nfrom blue cloud to red sequence (~1.5 Gyr). This indicates that the AGN are not\ntriggered promptly and appear several dynamical timescales into the associated\nstar formation episode, implying that they typically couple only to residual\ngas, at a point where star formation has already declined significantly. While\nevidence for AGN feedback is strong in systems where the black hole is fed by\nthe cooling of hot gas, AGN triggered by mergers appear not to strongly\nregulate the associated star formation.
