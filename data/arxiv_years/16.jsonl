{"prompt": "  Although cooperation is central to the organisation of many social systems,\nrelatively little is known about cooperation in situations of collective\nemergency. When groups of people flee from a danger such as a burning building\nor a terrorist attack, the collective benefit of cooperation is important, but\nthe cost of helping is high and the temptation to defect is strong. To explore\nthe degree of cooperation in emergencies, we develop a new social game, the\nhelp-or-escape social dilemma. Under time and monetary pressure, players decide\nhow much risk they are willing to take in order to help others. Results\nindicated that players took as much risk to help others during emergencies as\nthey did under normal conditions. In both conditions, most players applied an\negalitarian heuristic and helped others until their chance of success equalled\nthat of the group. This strategy is less efficient during emergencies, however,\nbecause the increased time pressure results in fewer people helped.\nFurthermore, emergencies tend to amplify participants initial tendency to\ncooperate, with prosocials becoming even more cooperative and individualists\nbecoming even more selfish. Our framework offers new opportunities to study\nhuman cooperation and could help authorities to better manage crowd behaviours\nduring mass emergencies.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 16\n"}

The\nessential ingredients used in his work are the topologically twisted N = 4\nYang-Mills theory, localization equations and surface operators. In this paper\nwe extend his construction in two possible ways. On one hand we show that a\nslight modification of Witten's brane construction could lead, using certain\nwell defined duality transformations, to the model used by Ooguri-Vafa to study\nknot invariants using gravity duals. On the other hand, we argue that both\nthese constructions, of Witten and of Ooguri-Vafa, lead to two different\nseven-dimensional manifolds in M-theory from where the topological theories may\nappear from certain twisting of the G-flux action. The non-abelian nature of\nthe topological action may also be studied if we take the wrapped M2-brane\nstates in the theory. We discuss explicit constructions of the\nseven-dimensional manifolds in M-theory, and show that both the localization\nequations and surface operators appear naturally from the Hamiltonian formalism\nof the theories.

{"prompt": "  Unlike spiral galaxies such as the Milky Way, the majority of the stars in\nmassive elliptical galaxies were formed in a short period early in the history\nof the Universe. The duration of this formation period can be measured using\nthe ratio of magnesium to iron abundance ([Mg/Fe]), which reflects the relative\nenrichment by core-collapse and type Ia supernovae. For local galaxies, [Mg/Fe]\nprobes the combined formation history of all stars currently in the galaxy,\nincluding younger and metal-poor stars that were added during late-time\nmergers. Therefore, to directly constrain the initial star-formation period, we\nmust study galaxies at earlier epochs. The most distant galaxy for which\n[Mg/Fe] had previously been measured is at z~1.4, with\n[Mg/Fe]=0.45(+0.05,-0.19). A slightly earlier epoch (z~1.6) was probed by\nstacking the spectra of 24 massive quiescent galaxies, yielding an average\n[Mg/Fe] of 0.31+/-0.12. However, the relatively low S/N of the data and the use\nof index analysis techniques for both studies resulted in measurement errors\nthat are too large to allow us to form strong conclusions. Deeper spectra at\neven earlier epochs in combination with analysis techniques based on full\nspectral fitting are required to precisely measure the abundance pattern\nshortly after the major star-forming phase (z>2). Here we report a measurement\nof [Mg/Fe] for a massive quiescent galaxy at z=2.1. With [Mg/Fe]=0.59+/-0.11,\nthis galaxy is the most Mg-enhanced massive galaxy found so far, having twice\nthe Mg enhancement of similar-mass galaxies today.

The leading terms on the\ninteraction force, consisting of an anisotropic and an isotropic term, are\nsuccessfully identified in the third-order macroscopic equation recovered by\nthe lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE), and then new mathematical insights into\nthe pseudopotential LB model are provided. For the third-order anisotropic\nterm, numerical tests show that it can cause the stationary droplet to become\nout-of-round, which suggests the isotropic property of the LBE needs to be\nseriously considered in the pseudopotential LB model. By adopting the classical\nequilibrium moment or setting the so-called \"magic\" parameter to 1/12, the\nanisotropic term can be eliminated, which is found from the present third-order\nanalysis and also validated numerically. As for the third-order isotropic term,\nwhen and only when it is considered, accurate continuum form pressure tensor\ncan be definitely obtained, by which the predicted coexistence densities always\nagree well with the numerical results. Compared with this continuum form\npressure tensor, the classical discrete form pressure tensor is accurate only\nwhen the isotropic term is a specific one. At last, in the framework of the\npresent third-order analysis, a consistent scheme for third-order additional\nterm is proposed, which can be used to independently adjust the coexistence\ndensities and surface tension. Numerical tests are subsequently carried out to\nvalidate the present scheme.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 16\n"}

The method, based on the use of standard Young tableaux, takes\nadvantage of the full $SU(N)$ symmetry, allowing one to work directly in each\nirreducible representations of the global $SU(N)$ group. Since the $SU(N)$\nsinglet sector is often much smaller than the full Hilbert space, this enables\none to reach much larger system sizes than with conventional exact\ndiagonalizations.

{"prompt": "  Understanding the real achievable performance of mobile ad hoc networks\n(MANETs) under practical network constraints is of great importance for their\napplications in future highly heterogeneous wireless network environments. This\npaper explores, for the first time, the performance modeling for MANETs under a\ngeneral limited buffer constraint, where each network node maintains a limited\nsource buffer of size $B_s$ to store its locally generated packets and also a\nlimited shared relay buffer of size $B_r$ to store relay packets for other\nnodes. Based on the Queuing theory and birth-death chain theory, we first\ndevelop a general theoretical framework to fully depict the source/relay buffer\noccupancy process in such a MANET, which applies to any distributed MAC\nprotocol and any mobility model that leads to the uniform distribution of\nnodes' locations in steady state. With the help of this framework, we then\nderive the exact expressions of several key network performance metrics,\nincluding achievable throughput, throughput capacity, and expected end-to-end\ndelay. We further conduct case studies under two network scenarios and provide\nthe corresponding theoretical/simulation results to demonstrate the application\nas well as the efficiency of our theoretical framework.

In the\ndense mid-plane of these disks, planetesimals and planets are expected to form.\nThe first step in planet formation is the growth of dust particles from\nsubmicrometer-sized grains to macroscopic mm-sized aggregates. The grain growth\nis accompanied by radial drift and vertical segregation of the particles within\nthe disk. To understand this essential evolutionary step, spatially resolved\nmulti-wavelength observations as well as photometric data are necessary which\nreflect the properties of both disk and dust. We present the first spatially\nresolved image obtained with NACO at the VLT in the L$_\\text{p}$ band of the\nnear edge-on protoplanetary disk FS Tau B. Based on this new image, a\npreviously published Hubble image in H band and the spectral energy\ndistribution from optical to millimeter wavelengths, we derive constraints on\nthe spatial dust distribution and the progress of grain growth. For this\npurpose we perform a disk modeling using the radiative transfer code MC3D.\nRadial drift and vertical sedimentation of the dust are not considered.

{"prompt": "  In a combinatorial auction with item bidding, agents participate in multiple\nsingle-item second-price auctions at once. As some items might be substitutes,\nagents need to strategize in order to maximize their utilities. A number of\nresults indicate that high welfare can be achieved this way, giving bounds on\nthe welfare at equilibrium. Recently, however, criticism has been raised that\nequilibria are hard to compute and therefore unlikely to be attained.\n  In this paper, we take a different perspective. We study simple best-response\ndynamics. That is, agents are activated one after the other and each activated\nagent updates his strategy myopically to a best response against the other\nagents' current strategies. Often these dynamics may take exponentially long\nbefore they converge or they may not converge at all. However, as we show,\nconvergence is not even necessary for good welfare guarantees. Given that\nagents' bid updates are aggressive enough but not too aggressive, the game will\nremain in states of good welfare after each agent has updated his bid at least\nonce.\n  In more detail, we show that if agents have fractionally subadditive\nvaluations, natural dynamics reach and remain in a state that provides a $1/3$\napproximation to the optimal welfare after each agent has updated his bid at\nleast once. For subadditive valuations, we can guarantee an $\\Omega(1/\\log m)$\napproximation in case of $m$ items that applies after each agent has updated\nhis bid at least once and at any point after that.

{"prompt": "  The verification of quantum devices is an important aspect of quantum\ninformation, especially with the emergence of more advanced experimental\nimplementations of computation and secure communication. Within this, the\ntheory of device-independent robust self-testing via Bell tests has reached a\nlevel of maturity now that many quantum states and measurements can be verified\nwithout direct access to the quantum systems: interaction with the devices is\nsolely classical. However, the requirements for this robust level of\nverification are daunting and require high levels of experimental accuracy. In\nthis paper we discuss the possibility of self-testing where we have direct\naccess to part of the quantum device. This motivates the study of self-testing\nvia EPR-steering, an intermediate form of entanglement verification between\nfull state tomography and a Bell test. Quantum non-locality implies\nEPR-steering so results in the former can apply in the latter, but we ask what\nadvantages may be gleaned from the latter over the former given that one can do\npartial state tomography. We show in the case of self-testing a maximally\nentangled two-qubit state, or ebit, EPR-steering allows for simpler analysis\nand better error tolerance than in the case of full device-independence. On the\nother hand, this improvement is only a constant improvement and (up to\nconstants) is the best one can hope for. Finally, we indicate that the main\nadvantage in self-testing based on EPR-steering could be in the case of\nself-testing multi-partite quantum states and measurements. For example, it may\nbe easier to establish a tensor product structure for a particular party's\nHilbert space even if we do not have access to their part of the global quantum\nsystem.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 16\n"}

Those that remained starless did\nbriefly acquire a centrally concentrated density configuration that mimicked\nthe density profile of a unstable Bonnor Ebert sphere before rebounding, (ii)\nthree of our test cores viz. L694-2, L1689-SMM16 and L1521F remained starless\ndespite becoming thermally super-critical. On the contrary B68 and L1517B\nremained sub-critical; L1521F collapsed to become a VeLLO only when gas-cooling\nwas enhanced by increasing the size of dust-grains. This result is robust, for\nother cores viz. B68, L694-2, L1517B and L1689 that previously remained\nstarless could also be similarly induced to collapse. Our principle conclusions\nare : (a) acquiring the thermally super-critical state does not ensure that a\ncore will necessarily become protostellar, (b) potentially star-forming cores\n(VeLLO L1521F here), could be experiencing coagulation of dust-grains that must\nenhance the gas-dust coupling and in turn lower the gas temperature, thereby\nassisting collapse. This hypothesis appears to have some observational support,\nand (c) depending on its dynamic state at any given epoch, a core could appear\nto be pressure-confined, gravitationally/virially bound, suggesting that\ngravitational/virial boundedness of a core is insufficient to ensure it will\nform stars, though it is crucial for gas in a contracting core to cool\nefficiently so it can collapse further to become protostellar.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 16\n"}

The\npost-processing could have been done directly from the finite element solution\nthat results in locally conservative flux on the element. However, the normal\nflux is not continuous at the elemental boundary.

{"prompt": "  Studies of cooperation in microbes often focus on one fitness component, with\nlittle information about or attention to the ecological context, and this can\nlead to paradoxical results. The life cycle of the social amoeba Dictyostelium\ndiscoideum includes a multicellular stage in which not necessarily clonal\namoebae aggregate upon starvation to form a possibly chimeric (genetically\nheterogeneous) fruiting body made of dead stalk and spores. The lab-measured\nreproductive skew in the spores of chimeras indicates strong social antagonism;\nthis should result in low genotypic diversity, which is inconsistent with\nobservations from nature. Two studies have suggested that this inconsistency\nstems from the one-dimensional assessment of fitness (spore production) and\nthat the solution lies in tradeoffs between multiple traits, e.g.: spore size\nversus viability; and staying vegetative versus becoming dormant. We\ntheoretically explore different tradeoff-implementing mechanisms and provide a\nunifying ecological framework in which the two tradeoffs above, as well as\nnovel ones, arise collectively in response to characteristics of the\nenvironment. We find that spore production comes at the expense of vegetative\ncell production, time to development, and, depending on the experimental setup,\nspore size and viability. Furthermore, we find that all existing experimental\nresults regarding chimeric mixes can be qualitatively recapitulated without\nneeding to invoke social interactions, which allows for simple resolutions to\npreviously paradoxical results. We conclude that the complexities of life\nhistories, including social behavior and multicellularity, can only be\nunderstood in the appropriate multidimensional ecological context.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 16\n"}

FIPSER is based\non the flash analog to digital converter (FADC) concept, but has the potential\nto lower costs and power consumption by using an order of magnitude fewer\ndiscrete voltage levels.

Both methods show that\nutilizing 12 discrete voltage levels with a sampling rate of 4 samples per full\nwidth half maximum (FWHM) of the pulse achieves an amplitude resolution that is\nbetter than the Poisson limit for photon-counting experiments. The time\nresolution achieved in this configuration ranges between 0.02 - 0.16 FWHM and\ndepends on the pulse amplitude.

This resolves a conjecture of Armstrong,\nRhoades and the first author, and relates to Lie-theoretic conjectures and\nresults of Bazlov, Broer, Joseph, Reeder, and Stembridge, and also Deconcini,\nPapi, and Procesi.

{"prompt": "  Many properties of the Milky Way's dark matter halo, including its mass\nassembly history, concentration, and subhalo population, remain poorly\nconstrained. We explore the connection between these properties of the Milky\nWay and its satellite galaxy population, especially the implication of the\npresence of the Magellanic Clouds for the properties of the Milky Way halo.\nUsing a suite of high-resolution $N$-body simulations of Milky Way-mass halos\nwith a fixed final Mvir ~ 10^{12.1}Msun, we find that the presence of\nMagellanic Cloud-like satellites strongly correlates with the assembly history,\nconcentration, and subhalo population of the host halo, such that Milky\nWay-mass systems with Magellanic Clouds have lower concentration, more rapid\nrecent accretion, and more massive subhalos than typical halos of the same\nmass. Using a flexible semi-analytic galaxy formation model that is tuned to\nreproduce the stellar mass function of the classical dwarf galaxies of the\nMilky Way with Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo, we show that adopting host halos with\ndifferent mass-assembly histories and concentrations can lead to different\nbest-fit models for galaxy-formation physics, especially for the strength of\nfeedback. These biases arise because the presence of the Magellanic Clouds\nboosts the overall population of high-mass subhalos, thus requiring a different\nstellar-mass-to-halo-mass ratio to match the data. These biases also lead to\nsignificant differences in the mass--metallicity relation, the kinematics of\nlow-mass satellites, the number counts of small satellites associated with the\nMagellanic Clouds, and the stellar mass of Milky Way itself. Observations of\nthese galaxy properties can thus provide useful constraints on the properties\nof the Milky Way halo.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 16\n"}

The recent introduction of chains, where a donor without a\npaired patient triggers a sequence of donations without requiring a kidney in\nreturn, increased the efficacy of fielded kidney exchanges---while also\ndramatically raising the empirical computational hardness of clearing the\nmarket in practice. While chains can be quite long, unbounded-length chains are\nnot desirable: planned donations can fail before transplant for a variety of\nreasons, and the failure of a single donation causes the rest of that chain to\nfail, so parallel shorter chains are better in practice.\n  In this paper, we address the tractable clearing of kidney exchanges with\nshort cycles and chains that are long but bounded.

In addition, SQUIDs are extremely sensitive\nsensors allowing to transduce magnetic flux into measurable electric signals.\nAs a consequence, any physical observable that can be converted into magnetic\nflux, e.g., current, magnetization, magnetic field or position, becomes easily\naccessible to SQUID sensors.

{"prompt": "  To simulate the energy balance of coronal plasmas on macroscopic scales, we\noften require the specification of the coronal heating mechanism in some\nfunctional form. To go beyond empirical formulations and to build a more\nphysically motivated heating function, we investigate the\nwave-turbulence-driven (WTD) phenomenology for the heating of closed coronal\nloops. Our implementation is designed to capture the large-scale propagation,\nreflection, and dissipation of wave turbulence along a loop. The parameter\nspace of this model is explored by solving the coupled WTD and hydrodynamic\nevolution in 1D for an idealized loop. The relevance to a range of solar\nconditions is also established by computing solutions for over one hundred\nloops extracted from a realistic 3D coronal field. Due to the implicit\ndependence of the WTD heating model on loop geometry and plasma properties\nalong the loop and at the footpoints, we find that this model can significantly\nreduce the number of free parameters when compared to traditional empirical\nheating models, and still robustly describe a broad range of quiet-sun and\nactive region conditions. The importance of the self-reflection term in\nproducing relatively short heating scale heights and thermal nonequilibrium\ncycles is also discussed.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 16\n"}
{"prompt": "  Oxide interfaces, including the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface, have been a subject\nof intense interest for over a decade due to their rich physics and potential\nas low dimensional nanoelectronic systems. The field has reached the stage\nwhere efforts are invested in developing devices. It is critical now to\nunderstand the functionalities and limitations of such devices. Recent scanning\nprobe measurements of the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface have revealed locally\nenhanced current flow and accumulation of charge along channels related to\nSrTiO3 structural domains. These observations raised a key question regarding\nthe role these modulations play in the macroscopic properties of devices. Here\nwe show that the microscopic picture, mapped by scanning superconducting\nquantum interference device, accounts for a substantial part of the\nmacroscopically measured transport anisotropy. We compared local flux data with\ntransport values, measured simultaneously, over various SrTiO3 domain\nconfigurations. We show a clear relation between maps of local current density\nover specific domain configurations and the measured anisotropy for the same\ndevice. The domains divert the direction of current flow, resulting in a\ndirection dependent resistance. We also show that the modulation can be\nsignificant and that in some cases up to 95% of the current is modulated over\nthe channels. The orientation and distribution of the SrTiO3 structural domains\nchange between different cooldowns of the same device or when electric fields\nare applied, affecting the device behavior.

After\ncarefully assigning stellar mass to satellites at infall, we find that stars\nare stripped at a higher rate in SIDM than in CDM. In contrast, the total bound\ndark matter mass loss rate is minimally affected, with subhalo evaporation\nhaving negligible effects on satellites for viable SIDM models. Centrally\nlocated stars in SIDM haloes disperse out to larger radii as cores grow.\nConsequently, the half-light radius of satellites increases, stars become more\nvulnerable to tidal stripping, and the stellar mass function is suppressed. We\nfind that the ratio of core radius to tidal radius accurately predicts the\nrelative strength of enhanced SIDM stellar stripping. Velocity-independent SIDM\nmodels show a modest increase in the stellar stripping effect with satellite\nmass, whereas velocity-dependent SIDM models show a large increase in this\neffect towards lower masses, making observations of ultra-faint dwarfs prime\ntargets for distinguishing between and constraining SIDM models.

Particularly uncertain is the\ntemperature-dependence of optical properties of lower mantle minerals across\nthe spin transition as the spin state itself is a strong function of\ntemperature.

We find that the optical absorbance of low spin FeO6 is\nsubstantially increased at 1000-1200 K due to the partially lifted Laporte\nselection rule. The temperature-induced low to high spin transition, however,\nresults in a dramatic drop in absorbance of the FeO6-unit. The absorption edge\n(Fe-O charge transfer) red-shifts (~ 1 cm-1/K) with increasing temperature and\nat T above 1600 K becomes the dominant absorption mechanism in the visible\nrange, suppressing radiative conductivity.

New approaches are required to promote more efficient\nsampling. We present the design and implementation of the Extensible Toolkit\nfor Advanced Sampling and analYsis (ExTASY) for building and executing advanced\nsampling workflows on HPC systems. ExTASY provides Python based \"templated\nscripts\" that interface to an interoperable and high-performance pilot-based\nrun time system, which abstracts the complexity of managing multiple\nsimulations. ExTASY supports the use of existing highly-optimised parallel MD\ncode and their coupling to analysis tools based upon collective coordinates\nwhich do not require a priori knowledge of the system to bias. We describe two\nworkflows which both couple large \"ensembles\" of relatively short MD\nsimulations with analysis tools to automatically analyse the generated\ntrajectories and identify molecular conformational structures that will be used\non-the-fly as new starting points for further \"simulation-analysis\" iterations.\nOne of the workflows leverages the Locally Scaled Diffusion Maps technique; the\nother makes use of Complementary Coordinates techniques to enhance sampling and\ngenerate start-points for the next generation of MD simulations. We show that\nthe ExTASY tools have been deployed on a range of HPC systems including ARCHER\n(Cray CX30), Blue Waters (Cray XE6/XK7), and Stampede (Linux cluster), and that\ngood strong scaling can be obtained up to 1000s of MD simulations, independent\nof the size of each simulation. We discuss how ExTASY can be easily extended or\nmodified by end-users to build their own workflows, and ongoing work to improve\nthe usability and robustness of ExTASY.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 16\n"}

A 1-D dust settling model considering both\nphysical and chemical aspects is presented in this paper. Modeling results show\nthat dust grains evaporate as they descend into the hotter interior and form a\n\"condensation front,\" above which dust-composing major elements, Mg, Si, and\nFe, accumulate, creating a large temperature gradient. Repeated evaporation at\nthe front inhibits grain growth, and small grain sizes elevate the opacity away\nfrom the mid-plane. Self-consistent calculations including radiative heat\ntransfer and condensation theory suggest that the mid-disk temperature could be\nhigh enough for silicates to remain evaporated longer than previous estimates.\nThe formation of a condensation front leads to contrasting settling behaviors\nbetween highly refractory elements, such as Al and Ca, and moderately\nrefractory elements, such as Mg, Si, and Fe, suggesting that elemental\nabundance in planetesimals may not be a simple function of volatility.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 16\n"}

{"prompt": "  An initial three-station version of the Event Horizon Telescope, a\nmillimeter-wavelength very-long baseline interferometer, has observed\nSagittarius A* (Sgr A*) repeatedly from 2007 to 2013, resulting in the\nmeasurement of a variety of interferometric quantities. Of particular\nimportance, there is now a large set of closure phases, measured over a number\nof independent observing epochs. We analyze these observations within the\ncontext of a realization of semi-analytic radiatively inefficient disk models,\nimplicated by the low luminosity of Sgr A*. We find a broad consistency among\nthe various observing epochs and between different interferometric data types,\nwith the latter providing significant support for this class of models of Sgr\nA*. The new data significantly tighten existing constraints on the spin\nmagnitude and its orientation within this model context, finding a spin\nmagnitude of $a=0.10^{+0.30+0.56}_{-0.10-0.10}$, an inclination with respect to\nthe line of sight of\n$\\theta={60^\\circ}^{+5^\\circ+10^\\circ}_{-8^\\circ-13^\\circ}$, and a position\nangle of $\\xi={156^\\circ}^{+10^\\circ+14^\\circ}_{-17^\\circ-27^\\circ}$ east of\nnorth. These are in good agreement with previous analyses. Notably, the\nprevious $180^\\circ$ degeneracy in the position angle has now been conclusively\nbroken by the inclusion of the closure phase measurements. A reflection\ndegeneracy in the inclination remains, permitting two localizations of the spin\nvector orientation, one of which is in agreement with the orbital angular\nmomentum of the infrared gas cloud G2 and the clockwise disk of young stars.\nThis possibly supports a relationship between Sgr A*'s accretion flow and these\nlarger-scale features.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 16\n"}

{"prompt": "  Longitudinal analysis is important in many disciplines, such as the study of\nbehavioral transitions in social science. Only very recently, feature selection\nhas drawn adequate attention in the context of longitudinal modeling. Standard\ntechniques, such as generalized estimating equations, have been modified to\nselect features by imposing sparsity-inducing regularizers. However, they do\nnot explicitly model how a dependent variable relies on features measured at\nproximal time points. Recent graphical Granger modeling can select features in\nlagged time points but ignores the temporal correlations within an individual's\nrepeated measurements. We propose an approach to automatically and\nsimultaneously determine both the relevant features and the relevant temporal\npoints that impact the current outcome of the dependent variable. Meanwhile,\nthe proposed model takes into account the non-{\\em i.i.d} nature of the data by\nestimating the within-individual correlations. This approach decomposes model\nparameters into a summation of two components and imposes separate block-wise\nLASSO penalties to each component when building a linear model in terms of the\npast $\\tau$ measurements of features. One component is used to select features\nwhereas the other is used to select temporal contingent points. An accelerated\ngradient descent algorithm is developed to efficiently solve the related\noptimization problem with detailed convergence analysis and asymptotic\nanalysis.

The LH content of the\noutgoing medium serves as a readout of the GnRH signaling pathway activation in\nthe cells. The challenge lies in relating the LH content of the medium leaving\nthe chamber to the cellular processes producing LH secretion. To investigate\nthis relation we developed and analyzed a mathematical model consisting of\ncoupled partial differential equations describing LH secretion in a perifusion\ncell culture. We match the mathematical model to three different data sets and\ngive cellular mechanisms that explain the data. Our model illustrates the\nimportance of the negative feedback in the signaling pathway and receptor\ndesensitization.

We ana- lyze the model to understand the influence of\nparameters, like the velocity of the medium flow or the fraction collection\ntime, on the LH outcomes.

Free energy (potential of mean force, PMF) calculations have been\nperformed for water molecules leaving the first two hydration layers above the\ndolomite (104) surface under the following three conditions: without catalyst,\nwith monosaccharide (mannose) and with oligosaccharide (three units of\nmannose). MD simulations reveal that there is no obvious effect of\nmonosaccharide in lowering the dehydration barrier for surface Mg2+. However,\nwe found that there are metastable configurations of oligosaccharide, which can\ndecrease the dehydration barrier of surface Mg2+ by about 0.7-1.1 kcal/mol. In\nthese configurations, the molecule lies relatively flat on the surface and\nforms a bridge shape. The hydrophobic space near the surface created by the\nnon-polar -CH groups of the oligosaccharide in the bridge conformation is the\nreason for the observed reduction of dehydration barrier.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 16\n"}

The number of fragments required for\nchemical accuracy is still prohibitively expensive for ab-initio MBE to compete\nwith force field approximations for applications beyond single-point energies.\nAlongside the MBE, empirical models of ab-initio potential energy surfaces have\nimproved, especially non-linear models based on neural networks (NN) which can\nreproduce ab-initio potential energy surfaces rapidly and accurately. Although\nthey are fast, NNs suffer from their own curse of dimensionality; they must be\ntrained on a representative sample of chemical space. In this paper we examine\nthe synergy of the MBE and NN's, and explore their complementarity. The MBE\noffers a systematic way to treat systems of arbitrary size and intelligently\nsample chemical space. NN's reduce, by a factor in excess of $10^6$ the\ncomputational overhead of the MBE and reproduce the accuracy of ab-initio\ncalculations without specialized force fields.

In flat $\\Lambda$CDM we find a $4.8\\sigma$ tension between the base\nP15~CMB data and a distance ladder measurement, whereas the former are\nconsistent with the other datasets. In the curved $\\Lambda$CDM model we find\nsignificant tensions in most of the cases, arising from the well-known low\npower of the low-$\\ell$ multipoles of the CMB data. In the flat $\\Lambda$CDM\n$+A_\\mathrm{L}$ model, however, all datasets are consistent with the base\nP15~CMB observations except for the CMB lensing measurement, which remains in\nsignificant tension. This tension is driven by the increased power of the CMB\nlensing potential derived from the base P15~CMB constraints in both models,\npointing at either potentially unresolved systematic effects or the need for\nnew physics beyond the standard flat $\\Lambda$CDM model.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 16\n"}

We apply these ideas to sunward-moving flux ropes (2.5D\nmagnetic islands) formed during fast reconnection in a simulated eruptive\nflare. A simple analytic model is used to calculate the energy gain of\nparticles orbiting the field lines of the contracting magnetic islands in our\nultrahigh-resolution 2.5D numerical simulation. We find that the estimated\nenergy gains in a single island range up to a factor of five. This is higher\nthan that found by Drake et al. for islands in the terrestrial magnetosphere\nand at the heliopause, due to strong plasma compression that occurs at the\nflare current sheet. In order to increase their energy by two orders of\nmagnitude and plausibly account for the observed high-energy flare emission,\nthe electrons must visit multiple contracting islands. This mechanism should\nproduce sporadic emission because island formation is intermittent. Moreover, a\nlarge number of particles could be accelerated in each\nmagnetohydrodynamic-scale island, which may explain the inferred rates of\nenergetic-electron production in flares.

To address such issue, we propose a novel CMFD method\nusing Scaled Harris Feature Descriptors (SHFD) that preform consistently well\non forged images with SGO.

Photon fluctuation\nstudy, first one ever reported for this type of nanolaser, confirms the\nvalidity of this measurement technique.

Recently there have been claims that the quantum theory\ndeviates spectacularly from the classical theory on this time scale, even if\nthe occupancy numbers are extremely large. Furthermore, it is claimed that the\nquantum theory quickly thermalizes while the classical theory does not. The\nevidence for these claims comes from noticing a spectacular difference in the\ntime evolution of expectation values of quantum operators compared to the\nclassical micro-state evolution. If true, this would have dramatic consequences\nfor many important phenomena, including laboratory studies of interacting BECs,\ndark matter axions, preheating after inflation, etc. In this work we critically\nexamine these claims. We show that in fact the classical theory can describe\nthe quantum behavior in the high occupancy regime, even when interactions are\nlarge. The connection is that the expectation values of quantum operators in a\nsingle quantum micro-state are approximated by a corresponding classical\nensemble average over many classical micro-states. Furthermore, by the ergodic\ntheorem, a classical ensemble average of local fields with statistical\ntranslation invariance is the spatial average of a single micro-state.

Magnetic reconnection events (flares) during\nthe collision of stellar magnetospheres near periastron could, however, produce\nthe same periodic, broadband behavior when observed at a one-day cadence. To\nreveal the dominate physical mechanism seen in DQ Tau's low-cadence\nobservations, we have obtained continuous, moderate-cadence, multi-band\nphotometry over 10 orbital periods, supplemented with 27 nights of\nminute-cadence photometry centered on 4 separate periastron passages.

{"prompt": "  Languages and genes are both transmitted from generation to generation, with\nopportunity for differential reproduction and survivorship of forms. Here we\napply a rigorous inference framework, drawn from population genetics, to\ndistinguish between two broad mechanisms of language change: drift and\nselection. Drift is change that results from stochasticity in transmission and\nit may occur in the absence of any intrinsic difference between linguistic\nforms; whereas selection is truly an evolutionary force arising from intrinsic\ndifferences -- for example, when one form is preferred by members of the\npopulation. Using large corpora of parsed texts spanning the 12th century to\nthe 21st century, we analyze three examples of grammatical changes in English:\nthe regularization of past-tense verbs, the rise of the periphrastic `do', and\nsyntactic variation in verbal negation. We show that we can reject stochastic\ndrift in favor of a selective force driving some of these language changes, but\nnot others. The strength of drift depends on a word's frequency, and so drift\nprovides an alternative explanation for why some words are more prone to change\nthan others. Our results suggest an important role for stochasticity in\nlanguage change, and they provide a null model against which selective theories\nof language evolution must be compared.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 16\n"}

Kilonova/macronova is optical and near-infrared emission powered by\nradioactive decays of r-process nuclei. Emission from the dynamical ejecta with\n~0.01 Msun is likely to have a luminosity of ~10^{40}-10^{41} erg s^{-1} with a\ncharacteristic timescale of about 1 week. The spectral peak is located in red\noptical or near-infrared wavelengths. A subsequent accretion disk wind may\nprovide an additional luminosity, or an earlier/bluer emission if it is not\nabsorbed by the precedent dynamical ejecta. The detection of near-infrared\nexcess in the afterglow of short GRB 130603B and possible optical excess in GRB\n060614 supports the concept of the kilonova/macronova scenario. At 200 Mpc\ndistance, a typical brightness of kilonova/macronova with 0.01 Msun ejecta is\nexpected to be about 22 mag and the emission rapidly fades to >24 mag within\n~10 days after the merger.

{"prompt": "  Ranking items to be recommended to users is one of the main problems in large\nscale social media applications. This problem can be set up as a\nmulti-objective optimization problem to allow for trading off multiple,\npotentially conflicting objectives (that are driven by those items) against\neach other. Most previous approaches to this problem optimize for a single slot\nwithout considering the interaction effect of these items on one another.\n  In this paper, we develop a constrained multi-slot optimization formulation,\nwhich allows for modeling interactions among the items on the different slots.\nWe characterize the solution in terms of problem parameters and identify\nconditions under which an efficient solution is possible. The problem\nformulation results in a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). We\nprovide an algorithm that gives us an efficient solution by relaxing the\nconstraints of the QCQP minimally. Through simulated experiments, we show the\nbenefits of modeling interactions in a multi-slot ranking context, and the\nspeed and accuracy of our QCQP approximate solver against other state of the\nart methods.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 16\n"}

We focus on the\nfollowing three aspects of EM: (i) initialization; (ii) latent posterior\nestimation (E-step) and (iii) the parameter update (M-step). We show that\nsaliency and attention maps, our bottom-up and top-down cues respectively, of\nsimple images provide very good cues to learn an initialization for the\nEM-based algorithm. Intuitively, we show that before trying to learn to segment\ncomplex images, it is much easier and highly effective to first learn to\nsegment a set of simple images and then move towards the complex ones. Next, in\norder to update the parameters, we propose minimizing the combination of the\nstandard softmax loss and the KL divergence between the true latent posterior\nand the likelihood given by the CNN. We argue that this combination is more\nrobust to wrong predictions made by the expectation step of the EM method. We\nsupport this argument with empirical and visual results.

To achieve this goal, an array of about\n100 telescopes is required, meaning a total reflective surface of several\nthousands of square meters.

We report\non the behaviour of these new regimes by varying the strength of the attractive\npotential.

Interestingly, on\nincreasing the strength of this parameter further there occurs an onset of\nmixed imperfect synchronized states where the solitary oscillators occur from\nboth the populations. Synchronized oscillators from both the populations are\nlocked to a common average frequency. In both the cases of imperfect\nsynchronized states synchronized oscillators exhibit periodic motion while the\nsolitary oscillators are quasi-periodic in nature. In this region, for\nspatially prepared initial conditions, we can observe the mixed chimera states\nwhere the coexistence of synchronized and desynchronized oscillations occur\nfrom both the populations. On the other hand, imperfect synchronized states are\nnot always stable, and they can drift aperiodically due to instability caused\nby an increase of nonisochronicity parameter. We observe that these states are\nrobust to the introduction of frequency mismatch between the two populations.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 16\n"}

For this, the microturbulence velocity used with the 1D LHD model\natmosphere was derived from the hydrodynamical CO5BOLD model atmosphere.

{"prompt": "  The knowledge of the structure of the magnetic field inside a blazar jet, as\ndeduced from polarization observations at radio to optical wavelengths, is\nclosely related to the formation and propagation of relativistic jets that\nresult from accretion onto supermassive black holes. However, a largely\nunexplored aspect of the theoretical understanding of radiation transfer\nphysics in blazar jets has been the magnetic field geometry as revealed by the\npolarized emission and the connection between the variability in polarization\nand flux across the spectrum. Here, we explore the effects of various magnetic\ngeometries that can exist inside a blazar jet: parallel, oblique, toroidal, and\ntangled. We investigate the effects of changing the orientation of the magnetic\nfield, according to the above-mentioned geometries, on the resulting\nhigh-energy spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and spectral variability\npatterns (SVPs) of a typical blazar. We use the MUlti-ZOne Radiation Feedback\n(MUZORF) model of Joshi et al.

For star forming\ngalaxies there exists an upper mass limit beyond which outflows are suppressed\nby the gravitational field of the galaxy.

Since there is no prior model on the number of multipath\nreflections, current techniques assume a tap delay line filter (in the RF and\ndigital domain) with a large number of taps, and estimate the taps in the\nanalog and the digital domain.

For nominal coverages >=20 nm, quasi\n2D and polycrystalline films, with an average grain size of 50-100 nm and 3.5\nnm roughness, can be obtained.

{"prompt": "  An inverse cascade - energy transfer to progressively larger scales - is a\nsalient feature of two-dimensional turbulence. If the cascade reaches the\nsystem scale, it creates a coherent flow expected to have the largest available\nscale and conform with the symmetries of the domain. In a doubly periodic\nrectangle, the mean flow with zero total momentum was therefore believed to be\nunidirectional, with two jets along the short side; while for an aspect ratio\nclose to unity, a vortex dipole was expected. Using direct numerical\nsimulations, we show that in fact neither the box symmetry is respected nor the\nlargest scale is realized: the flow is never purely unidirectional since the\ninverse cascade produces coherent vortices, whose number and relative motion\nare determined by the aspect ratio. This spontaneous symmetry breaking is\nclosely related to the hierarchy of averaging times. Long-time averaging\nrestores translational invariance due to vortex wandering along one direction,\nand gives jets whose profile, however, can be deduced neither from the\nlargest-available-scale argument, nor from the often employed maximum-entropy\nprinciple or quasi-linear approximation.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 16\n"}

{"prompt": "  We use numerical simulations to examine the effects of radial migration on\nthe vertical structure of galaxy disks.

The disks develop different\nnon-axisymmetric patterns, ranging from feeble, long-lived multiple arms to\nstrong, rapidly-evolving few-armed spirals. These fluctuations induce radial\nmigration through secular changes in the angular momentum of disk particles,\nmixing the disk radially and blurring pre-existing gradients. Migration affects\nprimarily stars with small vertical excursions, regardless of spiral pattern.\nThis \"provenance bias\" largely determines the vertical structure of migrating\nstars: inward migrators thin down as they move in, whereas outward migrators do\nnot thicken up but rather preserve the disk scale height at destination.\nMigrators of equal birth radius thus develop a strong scale-height gradient,\nnot by flaring out as commonly assumed, but by thinning down as they spread\ninward. Similar gradients have been observed for low-[$\\alpha$/Fe]\nmono-abundance populations (MAPs) in the Galaxy but our results argue against\ninterpreting them as a consequence of radial migration. This is because outward\nmigration does not lead to thickening, implying that the maximum scale height\nof any population should reflect its value at birth. In contrast, Galactic MAPs\nhave scale heights that increase monotonically outwards, reaching values that\ngreatly exceed those at their presumed birth radii. Given the strong vertical\nbias affecting migration, a proper assessment of the importance of radial\nmigration in the Galaxy should take carefully into account the strong radial\ndependence of the scale heights of the various stellar populations.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 16\n"}

Results: We\nshow that in low-viscosity protoplanetary disks (with a monotonous surface\ndensity similar to that of the minimum-mass solar nebula), the flow of pebbles\ndoes not usually reach the required surface density to form planetesimals by\nstreaming instability. We show, however, that if the pebble-to-gas-mass flux\nexceeds a critical value, no steady solution can be found for the solid-to-gas\nratio.

Conclusions:\nThis formation of dust-rich planetesimals may occur for extended periods of\ntime, while the snow line sweeps from several au to inside of 1 au.

We detect significant bumps and\ndips, both narrow and broad: two peaks on either side of the progenitor, each\nonly a fraction of a degree across, and two gaps, $\\sim2^{\\circ}$ and\n$\\sim9^{\\circ}$ wide, the latter accompanied by a gargantuan lump of debris.\nThis largest density feature results in a pronounced inter-tail asymmetry which\ncannot be made consistent with an unperturbed stream according to a suite of\nsimulations we have produced. We conjecture that the sharp peaks around Pal 5\nare epicyclic overdensities, while the two dips are consistent with impacts by\nsubhaloes. Assuming an age of 3.4 Gyr for Pal 5, these two gaps would\ncorrespond to the characteristic size of gaps created by subhaloes in the mass\nrange of $10^6-10^7 M_\\odot$ and $10^7-10^8 M_\\odot$ respectively. In addition\nto dark substructure, we find that the bar of the Milky Way can plausibly\nproduce the asymmetric density seen in Pal 5 and that GMCs could cause the\nsmaller gap.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 16\n"}

This paper focuses on distributed interference management for\ndownlink small cell networks. We address the optimization of transmit\nstrategies from both the game theoretical and the network utility maximization\n(NUM) perspectives and show that they can be unified in a generalized Nash\nequilibrium problem (GNEP) framework. Specifically, the small cell network\ndesign is first formulated as a GNEP, where the SBSs and MBS compete for the\nspectral resources by maximizing their own rates while satisfying global\nquality of service (QoS) constraints. We analyze the GNEP via variational\ninequality theory and propose distributed algorithms, which only require the\nbroadcasting of some pricing information, to achieve a generalized Nash\nequilibrium (GNE). Then, we also consider a nonconvex NUM problem that aims to\nmaximize the sum rate of all BSs subject to global QoS constraints. We\nestablish the connection between the NUM problem and a penalized GNEP and show\nthat its stationary solution can be obtained via a fixed point iteration of the\nGNE. We propose GNEP-based distributed algorithms that achieve a stationary\nsolution of the NUM problem at the expense of additional signaling overhead and\ncomplexity. The convergence of the proposed algorithms is proved and guaranteed\nfor properly chosen algorithm parameters. The proposed GNEP framework can scale\nfrom a QoS constrained game to a NUM design for small cell networks by trading\noff signaling overhead and complexity.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 16\n"}

Here we revisit the same SNR rim with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, 11\nyears after the first observation. This longer baseline than previously\navailable allows us to determine a more accurate proper motion of the\nnonthermal X-ray filament, revealing a much lower velocity of 3000 \\pm 340 km/s\n(and even slower at a brighter region). Although the value has dropped to a\nhalf of that from the previous X-ray measurement, it is still higher than the\nmean velocity of the H-alpha filaments in this region (~1200 km/s).

This scenario, however, faces major problems, in\nparticular the J-band brightening and the resurgence of FeH absorption at the L\nto T transition, and a physical first-principle understanding of this\ntransition is lacking. In this paper, we propose a new, completely different\nexplanation for BD and extrasolar giant planet (EGP) spectral evolution,\nwithout the need to invoke clouds. We show that, due to the slowness of the\nCO/CH4 and N2/NH3 chemical reactions, brown dwarf (L and T, respectively) and\nEGP atmospheres are subject to a thermo-chemical instability similar in nature\nto the fingering or chemical convective instability present in Earth oceans and\nat the Earth core/mantle boundary.

{"prompt": "  Fisher vector (FV) has become a popular image representation. One notable\nunderlying assumption of the FV framework is that local descriptors are well\ndecorrelated within each cluster so that the covariance matrix for each\nGaussian can be simplified to be diagonal. Though the FV usually relies on the\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) to decorrelate local features, the PCA is\napplied to the entire training data and hence it only diagonalizes the\n\\textit{universal} covariance matrix, rather than those w.r.t. the local\ncomponents. As a result, the local decorrelation assumption is usually not\nsupported in practice.\n  To relax this assumption, this paper proposes a completed model of the Fisher\nvector, which is termed as the Completed Fisher vector (CFV).

We show\nthat threats to plausible deniability of interest are readily detectable for\nall topics tested in an extensive testing program. We show this remains the\ncase when attempting to disrupt search engine learning through noise query\ninjection and click obfuscation are used. We use our model we design a defence\ntechnique exploiting uninteresting, proxy topics and show that it provides\namore effective defence of plausible deniability in our experiments.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 16\n"}

{"prompt": "  Motivated by models of human decision making proposed to explain commonly\nobserved deviations from conventional expected value preferences, we formulate\ntwo stochastic multi-armed bandit problems with distorted probabilities on the\ncost distributions: the classic $K$-armed bandit and the linearly parameterized\nbandit. In both settings, we propose algorithms that are inspired by Upper\nConfidence Bound (UCB), incorporate cost distortions, and exhibit sublinear\nregret assuming \\holder continuous weight distortion functions. For the\n$K$-armed setting, we show that the algorithm, called W-UCB, achieves\nproblem-dependent regret $O(L^2 M^2 \\log n/ \\Delta^{\\frac{2}{\\alpha}-1})$,\nwhere $n$ is the number of plays, $\\Delta$ is the gap in distorted expected\nvalue between the best and next best arm, $L$ and $\\alpha$ are the H\\\"{o}lder\nconstants for the distortion function, and $M$ is an upper bound on costs, and\na problem-independent regret bound of\n$O((KL^2M^2)^{\\alpha/2}n^{(2-\\alpha)/2})$. We also present a matching lower\nbound on the regret, showing that the regret of W-UCB is essentially\nunimprovable over the class of H\\\"{o}lder-continuous weight distortions. For\nthe linearly parameterized setting, we develop a new algorithm, a variant of\nthe Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty Linear bandit (OFUL) algorithm called\nWOFUL (Weight-distorted OFUL), and show that it has regret $O(d\\sqrt{n} \\;\n\\mbox{polylog}(n))$ with high probability, for sub-Gaussian cost distributions.\nFinally, numerical examples demonstrate the advantages resulting from using\ndistortion-aware learning algorithms.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 16\n"}

{"prompt": "  Generalized squeezing rotating-wave approximation (GSRWA) is proposed by\nemploying both the displacement and the squeezing transformations. A solvable\nHamiltonian is reformulated in the same form as the ordinary RWA ones. For a\nqubit coupled to oscillators experiment, a well-defined\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger-cat-like entangled state is given by the displaced-squeezed\noscillator state instead of the original displaced state. For the isotropic\nRabi case, the mean photon number and the ground-state energy are expressed\nanalytically with additional squeezing terms, exhibiting a substantial\nimprovement of the GSRWA. And the ground-state energy in the anisotropic Rabi\nmodel confirms the effectiveness of the GSRWA. Due to the squeezing effect, the\nGSRWA improves the previous methods only with the displacement transformation\nin a wide range of coupling strengths even for large atom frequency.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 16\n"}
{"prompt": "  Effective and accurate diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus (DM), as well as its\nearly stage Impaired Glucose Regulation (IGR), has attracted much attention\nrecently. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) [3], [5] etc. has proved that\ntongue, face and sublingual diagnosis as a noninvasive method is a reasonable\nway for disease detection. However, most previous works only focus on a single\nmodality (tongue, face or sublingual) for diagnosis, although different\nmodalities may provide complementary information for the diagnosis of DM and\nIGR. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal classification method to\ndiscriminate between DM (or IGR) and healthy controls. Specially, the tongue,\nfacial and sublingual images are first collected by using a non-invasive\ncapture device. The color, texture and geometry features of these three types\nof images are then extracted, respectively. Finally, our so-called multi-modal\nsimilar and specific learning (MMSSL) approach is proposed to combine features\nof tongue, face and sublingual, which not only exploits the correlation but\nalso extracts individual components among them. Experimental results on a\ndataset consisting of 192 Healthy, 198 DM and 114 IGR samples (all samples were\nobtained from Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine)\nsubstantiate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method for the\ndiagnosis of DM and IGR, compared to the case of using a single modality.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 16\n"}
{"prompt": "  We initiate a systematic study of the cohomology of cluster varieties.

We give a complete description of the highest weight part of the\nmixed Hodge structure of these cluster varieties, and develop the notion of a\nstandard differential form on a cluster variety.

{"prompt": "  We analyze 15,000 spectra of 29 stellar-mass black hole candidates collected\nover the 16-year mission lifetime of RXTE using a simple phenomenological\nmodel. As these black holes vary widely in luminosity and progress through a\nsequence of spectral states, which we broadly refer to as hard and soft, we\nfocus on two spectral components: The Compton power law and the reflection\nspectrum it generates by illuminating the accretion disk. Our proxy for the\nstrength of reflection is the equivalent width of the Fe-K line as measured\nwith respect to the power law. A key distinction of our work is that for all\nstates we estimate the continuum under the line by excluding the thermal disk\ncomponent and using only the component that is responsible for fluorescing the\nFe-K line, namely the Compton power law. We find that reflection is several\ntimes more pronounced (~3) in soft compared to hard spectral states. This is\nmost readily caused by the dilution of the Fe line amplitude from Compton\nscattering in the corona, which has a higher optical depth in hard states.\nAlternatively, this could be explained by a more compact corona in soft\n(compared to hard) states, which would result in a higher reflection fraction.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 16\n"}
