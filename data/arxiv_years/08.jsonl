We want to investigate how all the information\ncontained in the distribution of impacting photon packages can be optimally\nused to decrease the noise in the surface brightness distributions and hence to\nincrease the efficiency of Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations.\n  We demonstrate that the estimate of the surface brightness distribution in a\nMonte Carlo radiative transfer simulation is similar to the estimate of the\ndensity distribution in an SPH simulation. Based on this similarity, a recipe\nis constructed for smart detectors that take full advantage of the exact\nlocation of the impact of the photon packages. Several types of smart\ndetectors, each corresponding to a different smoothing kernel, are presented.\nWe show that smart detectors, while preserving the same effective resolution,\nreduce the noise in the surface brightness distributions compared to the\nclassical detectors. The most efficient smart detector realizes a noise\nreduction of about 10%, which corresponds to a reduction of the required number\nof photon packages (i.e. a reduction of the simulation run time) of 20%. As the\npractical implementation of the smart detectors is straightforward and the\nadditional computational cost is completely negligible, we recommend the use of\nsmart detectors in Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 08\n"}

For the most massive stars of our\nsample (B8 to B2 type), the excitation diagrams are reproduced well by a model\nof photodissociation regions (PDR). Our results favor an interpretation in\nterms of large CS envelopes, remnants of the molecular clouds in which the\nstars were formed.

This is demonstrated using a semianalytic\nsimulation of galaxy formation within the standard hierarchical scenario of\nstructure formation. The assumed threshold mass is motivated by the prediction\nof stable shock heating above this mass and the finding that such a shutdown\nreproduces the observed distribution of galaxies in luminosity and colour.The\nshutdown at a critical halo mass introduces a characteristic stellar mass for\nthe transition of galaxies into the `red sequence' of the galaxy\ncolour-magnitude diagram. Central galaxies of haloes that are more massive\ntoday have reached this mass earlier and can therefore grow further along the\nred sequence by dry mergers, ending up more massive and containing older stars.\nSmall galaxies formed in haloes below the critical mass can shutdown late, when\nthey fall into haloes above the critical mass and become satellites.

We then compare the energy densities in the radiation, the B field, and\nthe mechanical motions as deduced from the C^17O 3-2 line emission. We conclude\nthat the B field structures are already overwhelmed and dominated by the\nradiation, outflows, and turbulence from the newly formed massive stars.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 08\n"}
{"prompt": "  We present new fully self-consistent models of the formation and evolution of\nisolated dwarf galaxies. We have used the publicly available N-body/SPH code\nHYDRA, to which we have added a set of star formation criteria, and\nprescriptions for chemical enrichment (taking into account contributions from\nboth SNIa and SNII), supernova feedback, and gas cooling. The models follow the\nevolution of an initially homogeneous gas cloud collapsing in a pre-existing\ndark-matter halo. These simplified initial conditions are supported by the\nmerger trees of isolated dwarf galaxies extracted from the milli-Millennium\nSimulation.\n  The star-formation histories of the model galaxies exhibit burst-like\nbehaviour. These bursts are a consequence of the blow-out and subsequent\nin-fall of gas. The amount of gas that leaves the galaxy for good is found to\nbe small, in absolute numbers, ranging between 3x10^7 Msol and 6x10^7 Msol .\nFor the least massive models, however, this is over 80 per cent of their\ninitial gas mass. The local fluctuations in gas density are strong enough to\ntrigger star-bursts in the massive models, or to inhibit anything more than\nsmall residual star formation for the less massive models. Between these\nstar-bursts there can be time intervals of several Gyrs.\n  We have compared model predictions with available data for the relations\nbetween luminosity and surface brightness profile, half-light radius, central\nvelocity dispersion, broad band colour (B-V) and metallicity, as well as the\nlocation relative to the fundamental plane.

In this\nscenario, the hidden SUSY breaking sector involves an anomalous U(1)\nPeccei-Quinn symmetry which forbids bare mu and B mu terms. This sector\ntypically breaks supersymmetry at the desired range of energy scales through a\nsimple stringy hybrid of a Fayet and Polonyi model. A variant of the\nGiudice-Masiero mechanism generates the value mu ~ 10^2 - 10^3 GeV when the\nhidden sector scale of supersymmetry breaking is F^(1/2) ~ 10^(8.5) GeV.\nFurther, the B mu problem is solved due to the mild hierarchy between the GUT\nscale and Planck scale. These models relate SUSY breaking with the QCD axion,\nand solve the strong CP problem through an axion with decay constant f_a ~\nM_(GUT) * mu / L, where L ~ 10^5 GeV is the characteristic scale of gaugino\nmass unification in gauge mediated models, and the ratio \\mu / L ~\nM_(GUT)/M_(pl) ~ 10^(-3).

Optical data\nfrom about twenty telescopes have been homogeneously calibrated and carefully\nassembled to construct an R-band light curve containing about 1340 data points\nin 42 days. This extremely well-sampled optical light curve allows us to follow\nthe dramatic flux variability of the source in detail. In addition, we show\nradio-to-UV spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at different epochs, which\nrepresent different brightness levels. In the considered period, the source\nvaried by 2.6 mag in a couple of weeks in the R band. Many episodes of fast\n(i.e. intranight) variability were observed, most notably on December 12, when\na flux increase of about 1.1 mag in 1.5 hours was detected, followed by a steep\ndecrease of about 1.2 mag in 1 hour. The contribution by the thermal component\nis difficult to assess, due to the uncertainties in the Galactic, and possibly\nalso intrinsic, extinction in the UV band. However, polynomial fitting of\nradio-to-UV SEDs reveals an increasing spectral bending going towards fainter\nstates, suggesting a UV excess likely due to the thermal emission from the\naccretion disc.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 08\n"}

Both, head-on and off-centre cloud collisions have been examined in\nthis work. We include self gravity in all our simulations.\n  Simulations presented here, are performed using the smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH) numerical scheme. Individual, pre-collision clouds are\nmodelled as pressure confined Bonnor-Ebert spheres. However, in the interest of\nbrevity the thermodynamic details of the problem are simplified and the gas\ntemperature is simply evolved by a barytropic equation of state. Obviously, the\ngas, to some extent suffers from thermal inertial effects. However, we note\nthat the dynamical timescale is much smaller than the local sound crossing time\nso that such effects should have minimum influence.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 08\n"}

Among the surprises are the appearance in the ground state of\nstructures that would normally be thermal excitations and thus prohibited at\nzero temperature. Examples include excess dislocations in the form of grain\nboundary scars for spherical crystals above a minimal system size, dislocation\nunbinding for toroidal hexatics, interstitial fractionalization in spherical\ncrystals and the appearance of well-separated disclinations for toroidal\ncrystals. Much of the analysis leads to universal predictions that do not\ndepend on the details of the microscopic interactions that lead to order in the\nfirst place.

Alternatively, if the hidden sector contains a\n1-generation version of the standard model with characteristic mass scale below\n1 MeV, even identical reheating temperatures are allowed.

For R>0.05, the \"tidal\nregime\", there is almost no dependence of dN/dt on R. To first order this is\nbecause the fraction of escapers per relaxation time, t_rh, scales\napproximately as R^1.5, which cancels out the r_h^1.5 term in t_rh. For R<0.05,\nthe \"isolated regime\", dN/dt scales as R^-1.5. Clusters that start with their\ninitial R, Ri, in the tidal regime dissolve completely in this regime and their\nt_dis is insensitive to the initial r_h. We predicts that clusters that start\nwith Ri<0.05 always expand to the tidal regime before final dissolution. Their\nt_dis has a shallower dependence on Ri than what would be expected when t_dis\nis a constant times t_rh. For realistic values of Ri, the lifetime varies by\nless than a factor of 1.5 due to changes in Ri.

The shortening releases magnetic energy by\nprogressing away from the reconnection site at the Alfven speed. This launches\ninward flows along the field lines whose collision creates a pair of\ngas-dynamic shocks. The shocks raise both the mass density and temperature\ninside the newly shortened flux tube. Reconnecting field lines whose initial\ndirections differ by more that 100 degrees can produce a concentrated knot of\nplasma hotter that 20 MK, consistent with observations. In spite of these high\ntemperatures, the shocks convert less than 10% of the liberated magnetic energy\ninto heat - the rest remains as kinetic energy of bulk motion. These\ngas-dynamic shocks arise only when the reconnection is impulsive and localized\nin all three dimensions; they are distinct from the slow magnetosonic shocks of\nthe Petschek steady-state reconnection model.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 08\n"}

{"prompt": "  Experimental measurements of the specific heat in glass-forming systems\nreveal anomalies in the temperature dependence of the specific heat, including\nthe so called \"specific heat peak\" in the vicinity of the glass transition. The\naim of this paper is to provide theoretical explanations of these anomalies in\ngeneral and a quantitative theory in the case of a simple model of\nglass-formation. We first present new simulation results for the specific heat\nin a classical model of a binary mixture. We show that in addition to the\nformerly observed specific heat peak there is a second peak at lower\ntemperatures which was not observable in earlier simulations. Second, we\npresent a general relation between the specific heat and the bulk modulus and\nthus offer a smooth connection between the liquid and amorphous solid states.\nThe central result of this paper is a connection between the micro-melting of\nclusters in the system and the appearance of specific heat peaks. We relate the\ntwo peaks to changes in the bulk and shear moduli. We propose that the\nphenomenon of glass-formation is accompanied by a fast change in the bulk and\nthe shear moduli, but these fast changes occur in different ranges of the\ntemperature. Lastly, we demonstrate how to construct a theory of the frequency\ndependent complex specific heat, expected from heterogeneous clustering in the\nliquid state of glass formers.

Here robust performance is defined as the achievement of a uniform\nspecified $L^{2}$-gain tolerance for a disturbance-to-error map combined with\nrobust stability. By setting the disturbance and error channels equal to zero,\nit is clear that any criterion for robust performance also produces a criterion\nfor robust stability. Counter-intuitively, as a consequence of the so-called\nMain Loop Theorem, application of a result on robust stability to a feedback\nconfiguration with an artificial full-block uncertainty operator added in\nfeedback connection between the error and disturbance signals produces a result\non robust performance.

The\namplitude of the signal is equal to the fraction sin I[9(M_p M_m)/16(M_p +\nM_m)^2] [r/R]^5 of the system crossing time R/c, where M_p and M_m are the the\nmasses of the planet and moon, r is their orbital separation, R is the distance\nbetween the host pulsar and planet-moon barycenter, I is the inclination of the\norbital plane of the planet, and c is the speed of light.

The worthiness of all\ncomponents in the schedule has to be continuously demonstrated in order for\nthem to remain there.

The\npropagating duration of the brightening is from 10 to 60 minutes, and from 10\nminutes to 70 minutes for the separating duration of the FRs. The velocities of\nthe propagation and the separation range from 3 km/s to 39 km/s and 3 km/s to\n15 km/s, respectively. Both of the propagating velocities and the separating\nvelocities are associated with the flare strength and the length of the FRs. It\nappears that the propagation and the separation are dynamically coupled, that\nis the greater the propagating velocity is, the faster the separation is.\nFurthermore, a greater propagating velocity corresponds to a greater\ndeceleration (or acceleration).

{"prompt": "  We present results on a survey to find extremely dust-reddened Type-1\nQuasars. Combining the FIRST radio survey, the 2MASS Infrared Survey and the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey, we have selected a candidate list of 122 potential\nred quasars. With more than 80% spectroscopically identified objects, well over\n50% are classified as dust-reddened Type 1 quasars, whose reddenings (E(B-V))\nrange from approximately 0.1 to 1.5 magnitudes. They lie well off the color\nselection windows usually used to detect quasars and many fall within the\nstellar locus, which would have made it impossible to find these objects with\ntraditional color selection techniques. The reddenings found are much more\nconsistent with obscuration happening in the host galaxy rather than stemming\nfrom the dust torus. We find an unusually high fraction of Broad Absorption\nLine (BAL) quasars at high redshift, all but one of them belonging to the Low\nIonization BAL (LoBAL) class and many also showing absorption the metastable\nFeII line (FeLoBAL). The discovery of further examples of dust-reddened LoBAL\nquasars provides more support for the hypothesis that BAL quasars (at least\nLoBAL quasars) represent an early stage in the lifetime of the quasar. The fact\nthat we see such a high fraction of BALs could indicate that the quasar is in a\nyoung phase in which quasar feedback from the BAL winds is suppressing star\nformation in the host galaxy.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 08\n"}

It is shown that the calculated cross sections are sensitive to\nthe couplings to the $2^+$ and $3^-$ excitation channels even at low energies,\nwhere these channels are closed. The sensitivity to the ion-ion potential is\ninvestigated by applying a conventional Woods-Saxon potential and the\nM3Y+repulsion potential, consisting of the M3Y double-folding potential and a\nrepulsive term that simulates the effect of the nuclear incompressibility. The\nbest overall fit to the data is obtained with a M3Y+repulsion potential which\nproduces a shallow potential in the entrance channel. The stepwise increase in\nmeasured fusion cross sections at high energies is also consistent with such a\nshallow potential. The steps are correlated with overcoming the barriers for\nthe angular momenta $L$ = 12, 14, 16, and 18.

During early stage\nof budding, the zenith angle of partial budded capsids, $\\alpha$, increases\nwith time as $\\alpha \\propto t^{1/3}$. However, when Gag-Gag attraction is\nweak, a metastable state of partial budding appears.

By keeping track of the individual photons we can\ndistinguish between photons in the Ly-alpha resonance and those with energy E <\n10.2 eV that do not interact further with gas. This separation is important\nbecause a Ly-alpha background can heat or cool the gas depending on the nature\nof the photons, and can have effects on the 21 cm radiation emitted by neutral\nH, which will probably become detectable at z > 6 in the near future by the\nnext generation radio interferometers.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 08\n"}

{"prompt": "  The inhabitants of the bush lupine in coastal California have been the\nsubject of scientific scrutiny in recent years. Observations of a\nhost-parasitoid interaction in the shrub's foliage, in which victims are\nsignificantly less motile than their exploiters, record stable spatial patterns\nin a fairly homogeneous environment. Though such pattern formation has been\nfound in reaction-diffusion models, the correspondence of these models to\ncontinuous-time predator-prey interactions does not reflect the reality of the\nsystem being studied. Near the root of the lupine, another host-parasitoid\ninteraction is also of considerable interest. In some cases this interaction,\nwhich promotes the health of the lupine, has been observed to be much more\npersistent than suggested by mathematical models.\n  In this work a discrete-time spatial model of the first host-parasitoid\nsystem is introduced. We analyze the model, describing its transient behavior\nand finding the conditions under which spatial patterns occur, as well as an\nestimate of outbreak size under those conditions. We consider the feasibility\nof the necessary conditions in the natural system by modeling the mechanisms\nresponsible for them, and discuss the effects of variable habitat on pattern\nformation. We also explore one possible explanation for the persistence of the\nsecond host-parasitoid system -- the existence of an alternate host. Under\ncertain surprising conditions and by means quite different from previous models\nof similar situations, an alternate host can greatly enhance persistence of the\nnematode parasitoid.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 08\n"}

Spatial derivatives of the linear density correlation, which were\nignored in the calculation of Bardeen, Bond, Kaiser & Szalay (1986), are\nincluded in our analysis. These functions exhibit large oscillations around the\nsound horizon scale for generic CDM power spectra. We derive the exact\nleading-order expression for the correlation of density peaks and demonstrate\nthe contribution of those spatial derivatives. In particular, we show that\nthese functions can modify significantly the baryon acoustic signature of\ndensity maxima relative to that of the linear density field. The effect depends\nupon the exact value of the peak height, the filter shape and size, and the\nsmall-scale behaviour of the transfer function. In the LambdaCDM cosmology, for\nmaxima identified in the density field smoothed at mass scale M\\approx\n10^{12}-10^{14}M_sun/h and with linear threshold height \\nu=1.673/\\sigma(M),\nthe contrast of the BAO can be a few tens of percent larger than in the linear\nmatter correlation. Overall, the BAO is amplified (damped) for threshold\nheights larger (less) than unity. Density maxima thus behave quite differently\nthan linearly biased tracers of the density field, whose acoustic signature is\na simple scaled version of the linear baryon acoustic oscillation. We also\ncalculate the mean streaming of peak pairs in the quasi-linear regime. We show\nthat the leading-order 2-point correlation and pairwise velocity of density\npeaks are consistent with a nonlinear, local biasing relation involving\ngradients of the density field. Biasing will be an important issue in\nascertaining how much of the enhancement of the BAO in the primeval correlation\nof density maxima propagates into the late-time clustering of galaxies.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 08\n"}

{"prompt": "  Genetic hitchhiking describes evolution at a neutral locus that is linked to\na selected locus.

However, recent theory (Pennings and Hermisson, 2006a; Pennings and\nHermisson, 2006b) has shown that recurrent beneficial mutation at biologically\nrealistic rates can lead to markedly different polymorphism patterns, so called\nsoft selective sweeps. We extend an approach that has recently been developed\nfor the classical hitchhiking model (Schweinsbergand Durrett, 2005; Etheridge,\nPfaffelhuber, Wakolbinger, 2006) to study the recurrent mutation scenario.

These dagger-limits can\nbe used to characterize the dagger-functor on the category of\nfinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, and so can be used as an equivalent\ndefinition of the inner product.

However, when those models are faced with the challenge of\nselecting a dependence structure from many, the use of standard model choice\nmethods is hampered by the unavailability of the normalising constant in the\nGibbs likelihood. In particular, from a Bayesian perspective, the computation\nof the posterior probabilities of the models under competition requires special\nlikelihood-free simulation techniques like the Approximate Bayesian Computation\n(ABC) algorithm that is intensively used in population genetics. We show in\nthis paper how to implement an ABC algorithm geared towards model choice in the\ngeneral setting of Gibbs random fields, demonstrating in particular that there\nexists a sufficient statistic across models. The accuracy of the approximation\nto the posterior probabilities can be further improved by importance sampling\non the distribution of the models.

The previous results\nfor the time-dependence of the corrections to $g_{ij}({\\bf x},t)/a^2(t)$ in the\ncase of multi-scalar field theories are now shown to apply for any theory whose\nanisotropic inertia vanishes to order $a^{-2}$. Further, it is shown that the\nadiabatic solutions are attractive as $a$ becomes large for the case of single\nfield inflation and now also for thermal equilibrium with no non-zero conserved\nquantities, and the $O(a^{-2})$ corrections to the other dynamical variables\nare explicitly calculated in both cases.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 08\n"}

A\ncomparison of observed line ratio values was made to those predicted by the\ntemperature and electron density dependent models of Case B hydrogen\nrecombination line theory.

Thus,\ntwo-phase co-existence in the vicinity of the phase transition region is\nprobable and has an important role for electromechanical properties.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 08\n"}
{"prompt": "  The Temperley-Lieb algebra may be thought of as a quotient of the Hecke\nalgebra of type A, acting on tensor space as the commutant of the usual action\nof quantum sl(2) on the n-th tensor power of the 2-dimensional irreducible\nmodule. We define and study a quotient of the Birman-Wenzl-Murakami algebra,\nwhich plays an analogous role for the 3-dimensional representation of quantum\nsl(2). In the course of the discussion we prove some general results about the\nradical of a cellular algebra, which may be of independent interest.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 08\n"}
{"prompt": "  In this paper, we construct (many) Kolyvagin systems out of Stickelberger\nelements, utilizing ideas borrowed from our previous work on Kolyvagin systems\nof Rubin-Stark elements. We show how to apply this construction to prove\nresults on the odd parts of the ideal class groups of CM fields which are\nabelian over a totally real field, and deduce the main conjecture of Iwasawa\ntheory for totally real fields (for totally odd characters). Although the main\nresults of this paper have already been established by Wiles, our approach\nprovides another example (which slightly differs from the case of Stark\nelements) on how to study Kolyvagin systems of core rank r > 1 (in the sense of\nMazur and Rubin). Also, by making use of the 'rigidity' of the collection of\nKolyvagin systems, we establish a link between the Stickelberger elements and\nthe Rubin-Stark elements.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 08\n"}
{"prompt": "  A quantum sl(2,R) coalgebra is shown to underly the construction of a large\nclass of superintegrable potentials on 3D curved spaces, that include the\nnon-constant curvature analogues of the spherical, hyperbolic and (anti-)de\nSitter spaces. The connection and curvature tensors for these \"deformed\" spaces\nare fully studied by working on two different phase spaces. The former directly\ncomes from a 3D symplectic realization of the deformed coalgebra, while the\nlatter is obtained through a map leading to a spherical-type phase space. In\nthis framework, the non-deformed limit is identified with the flat contraction\nleading to the Euclidean and Minkowskian spaces/potentials. The resulting\nHamiltonians always admit, at least, three functionally independent constants\nof motion coming from the coalgebra structure. Furthermore, the intrinsic\noscillator and Kepler potentials on such Riemannian and Lorentzian spaces of\nnon-constant curvature are identified, and several examples of them are\nexplicitly presented.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 08\n"}
{"prompt": "  We develop the N=8 superfield description of the Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson\n(BLG) model in its Nambu bracket (NB) realization.\n  The basic ingredient is the octet of scalar d=3 N=8 superfields depending\nalso on the coordinates of a compact three dimensional space M. It is\nrestricted by the 'superembedding-like' equation, which can be treated as\ncovariantization of the linearized superembedding equation for supermembrane\n(M2-brane) with respect volume preserving diffeomorphisms SDiff3 of M. The\ncurvatures of SDiff3 connection are expressed through the scalar superfields by\nthe N=8 superfield generalization of the Chern-Simons equation (super-CS\nequation). We show how the dynamical BLG equations appear when studying\nconsistency of these basic equations.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 08\n"}
