It is shown that in continuum space the singularity\nof the charge-density correlation function associated with short-wavelength\ncharge-ordering disappears when charge-density fluctuations are included by\nfollowing the Brazovskii approach. The related singularity of the individual\nFeynman diagrams contributing to the number-density correlation functions is\ncured when all the diagrams are segregated ito disjoint sets according to their\ntopological structure.

This\ndecreased significance is due to the number of redshift trials that are made\nand that are not taken into account in the original discovery paper. Therefore\nthese features must be attributed to statistical fluctuations. This is\nconfirmed by the RGS spectra, which have a higher signal to noise ratio than\nthe Chandra spectra, but do not show features at the same wavelengths.

Such coherent coupling\nhas been demonstrated in a variety of systems at low temperature1, 2. Of all\nquantum systems, spins are potentially the most important, because they offer\nvery long phase memories, sometimes even at room temperature. Although precise\ncontrol of spins is well established in conventional magnetic resonance3, 4,\nexisting techniques usually do not allow the readout of single spins because of\nlimited sensitivity. In this paper, we explore dipolar magnetic coupling\nbetween two single defects in diamond (nitrogen-vacancy and nitrogen) using\noptical readout of the single nitrogen-vacancy spin states. Long phase memory\ncombined with a defect separation of a few lattice spacings allow us to explore\nthe strong magnetic coupling regime. As the two-defect system was well-isolated\nfrom other defects, the long phase memory times of the single spins was not\ndiminished, despite the fact that dipolar interactions are usually seen as\nundesirable sources of decoherence. A coherent superposition of spin pair\nquantum states was achieved.

The predicted\nprimordial lithium abundance is a factor of two to three higher than the value\nmeasured in the atmospheres of old stars. With estimated errors of 10 to 25%,\nthis cosmological lithium discrepancy seriously challenges our understanding of\nstellar physics, Big Bang nucleosynthesis or both.

{"prompt": "  Message-passing iterative decoders for low-density parity-check (LDPC) block\ncodes are known to be subject to decoding failures due to so-called\npseudo-codewords. These failures can cause the large signal-to-noise ratio\nperformance of message-passing iterative decoding to be worse than that\npredicted by the maximum-likelihood decoding union bound. In this paper we\naddress the pseudo-codeword problem from the convolutional-code perspective. In\nparticular, we compare the performance of LDPC convolutional codes with that of\ntheir ``wrapped'' quasi-cyclic block versions and we show that the minimum\npseudo-weight of an LDPC convolutional code is at least as large as the minimum\npseudo-weight of an underlying quasi-cyclic code. This result, which parallels\na well-known relationship between the minimum Hamming weight of convolutional\ncodes and the minimum Hamming weight of their quasi-cyclic counterparts, is due\nto the fact that every pseudo-codeword in the convolutional code induces a\npseudo-codeword in the block code with pseudo-weight no larger than that of the\nconvolutional code's pseudo-codeword. This difference in the weight spectra\nleads to improved performance at low-to-moderate signal-to-noise ratios for the\nconvolutional code, a conclusion supported by simulation results.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 06\n"}

Allowing age and metallicity to be free parameters and\nassuming star formation began ~ 14 Gyr ago, we find that the mean age of all\nstars and stellar remnants increases from ~ 6 Gyr to ~ 8 Gyr and the mean\nglobal metallicity decreases from ~ -0.7 to ~ -0.9.

Our data were collected over 12 nights between 2004 December - 2005\nJuly on the Magellan Clay 6.5m telescope. Based on H$\\alpha$ line profiles,\nalong with a variety of other emission lines, we find clear evidence of\non-going accretion in three out of 11 eta Cha stars and two out of 32 TW Hydrae\nmembers. None of the 57 beta Pic or Tuc-Hor members shows measurable signs of\naccretion. Together, these results imply significant evolution of the disk\naccretion process within the first several Myr of a low-mass star's life. While\na few disks can continue to accrete for up to ~10 Myr, our findings suggest\nthat disks accreting for beyond that timescale are rather rare. This result\nprovides an indirect constraint on the timescale for gas dissipation in inner\ndisks and, in turn, on gas giant planet formation. All accretors in our sample\nare slow rotators, whereas non-accretors cover a large range in rotational\nvelocities. This may hint at rotational braking by disks at ages up to ~8 Myr.\nOur multi-epoch spectra confirm that emission-line variability is common even\nin somewhat older T Tauri stars, among which accretors tend to show\nparticularly strong variations. Thus, our results indicate that accretion and\nwind activity undergo significant and sustained variations throughout the\nlifetime of accretion disks.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 06\n"}

Analytic prescriptions are used to incorporate small-scale\nstructures that affect reionization, yet remain unresolved in the N-body\nsimulation. We show that the morphology of the HII regions is most dependent on\nthe global ionization fraction x_i. This is not to say that the bubble\nmorphology is completely independent of all parameters besides x_i. The next\nmost important dependence is that of the nature of the ionizing sources. The\nrarer the sources, the larger and more spherical the HII regions become. The\ntypical bubble size can vary by as much as a factor of 4 at fixed x_i between\ndifferent possible source prescriptions. The final relevant factor is the\nabundance of minihalos or of Lyman-limit systems. These systems suppress the\nlargest bubbles from growing, and the magnitude of this suppression depends on\nthe thermal history of the gas as well as the rate at which minihalos are\nphoto-evaporated.

These constraints, coupled with a theoretical model for stochastic\nexcitation, provide the rate 'P' at which energy is injected into the p-modes\nby turbulent convection. These energy rates are compared with those derived\ndirectly from the 3D simulations. The excitation rates obtained from the 3D\nsimulations are systematically lower than those computed from the\nsemi-analytical excitation model.

{"prompt": "  Aim: To determine whether or not gas-phase chemical models with homogeneous\nand time-independent physical conditions explain the many observed molecular\nabundances in astrophysical sources, it is crucial to estimate the\nuncertainties in the calculated abundances and compare them with the observed\nabundances and their uncertainties. Non linear amplification of the error and\nbifurcation may limit the applicability of chemical models. Here we study such\neffects on dense cloud chemistry. Method: Using a previously studied approach\nto uncertainties based on the representation of rate coefficient errors as log\nnormal distributions, we attempted to apply our approach using as input a\nvariety of different elemental abundances from those studied previously. In\nthis approach, all rate coefficients are varied randomly within their log\nnormal (Gaussian) distribution, and the time-dependent chemistry calculated\nanew many times so as to obtain good statistics for the uncertainties in the\ncalculated abundances. Results: Starting with so-called ``high-metal''\nelemental abundances, we found bimodal rather than Gaussian like distributions\nfor the abundances of many species and traced these strange distributions to an\nextreme sensitivity of the system to changes in the ratio of the cosmic ray\nionization rate zeta\\_He for He and that for molecular hydrogen zeta\\_H2. The\nsensitivity can be so extreme as to cause a region of bistability, which was\nsubsequently found to be more extensive for another choice of elemental\nabundances. To the best of our knowledge, the bistable solutions found in this\nway are the same as found previously by other authors, but it is best to think\nof the ratio zeta\\_He/zeta\\_H2 as a control parameter perpendicular to the\n''standard'' control parameter zeta/n\\_H.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 06\n"}

We argue that even for open quantum\nnonlinear systems in the deep quasi-classical region, these quantum effects can\nsurvive after decoherence and relaxation processes take place. We demonstrate\nthat these quantum effects in open quantum systems can be observed, for\nexample, in the frequency Fourier spectrum of the dynamical observables, or in\nthe corresponding spectral density of noise. Estimates are presented for\nBose-Einstein condensates, low temperature mechanical resonators, and nonlinear\noptical systems prepared in large amplitude coherent states. In particular, we\nshow that for Bose-Einstein condensate systems the characteristic time of\ndeviation of quantum dynamics for observables from the corresponding classical\ndynamics coincides with the characteristic time-scale of the well-known quantum\nnonlinear effect of phase diffusion.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 06\n"}

As a result, the gravitino is\nnaturally the lightest superpartner (LSP) and contact interactions between the\nhidden and the visible sector fields become stronger. We address\nphenomenologies for various IR cutoff scales. In particular, we investigate\ncollider phenomenology involving a scalar field (Polonyi field) in the hidden\nsector for the case with the IR cutoff around 10 TeV. We find a possibility\nthat the hidden sector scalar can be produced at the LHC and the International\nLinear Collider (ILC). Interestingly, the scalar behaves like the Higgs boson\nof the standard model in the production process, while its decay process is\nquite different and, once produced, it will provide us with a very clean\nsignature. The hidden sector may be no longer hidden.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 06\n"}

Field cooling\nprocedures for obtaining single domain samples are discussed. The anomalous\neffects are elaborated in the case of three geometries chosen to produce\nexperimentally unambiguous signals of this unusual magnetic state; e.g., it is\npredicted that a field in z-direction induces an anisotropy in the x-y plane.\nAnother geometry leads to a Hall voltage parallel to the magnetic field.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 06\n"}

We therefore used the ROSAT Bright Source Catalog and past observations in\nthe literature to identify X-ray point sources in and near the SNRs. Out of 54\nsources, we were immediately able to identify optical/IR counterparts to 41\nfrom existing data. We obtained Chandra snap-shot images of the remaining 13\nsources. Of these, 10 were point sources with readily identified counterparts,\ntwo were extended, and one was not detected in the Chandra observation but is\nlikely a flare star. One of the extended sources may be a pulsar wind nebula,\nbut if so it is probably not associated with the nearby SNR. We are then left\nwith no identified neutron stars in these six SNRs down to luminosity limits of\n\\~1e32 ergs/s.

As the\nresult the polarizations of emission and absorption lines depend on the 3D\ngeometry of the magnetic field as well as the direction and anisotropy of\nincident radiation. We consider a subset of astrophysically important atoms\nwith hyperfine structure. For emission lines we obtain the dependencies of the\ndirection of linear polarization on the directions of magnetic field and the\nincident pumping radiation. For absorption lines we establish when the\npolarization is perpendicular and parallel to magnetic field. For both emission\nand absorption lines we find the dependence on the degree of polarization on\nthe 3D geometry of magnetic field.

Detailed\nspectral and timing analysis was carried out on 4 of the brightest X-ray\nsources. One of these objects is identified with a Galactic foreground star and\nis a possible new RS CVn system. The other three are consistent with accreting\nX-ray binaries, though further evidence of short term variability is required\nto confirm this. We also find evidence of an underlying component, which is\nconcentrated on the bar region but has an extent of at least 6' (3 kpc) in the\nplane of the galaxy and +/- 1' (+/- 500 pc) perpendicular to it. This emission\nis best fitted by a thermal plasma plus power-law model but with high intrinsic\nabsorption consistent with its location in the central disc of the galaxy. We\ninterpret the soft component as diffuse thermal emission linked to regions of\ncurrent star formation, whilst the hard power-law component may originate in\nunresolved X-ray binary sources. The intrinsic luminosity of this residual disc\nemission may exceed Lx ~ 6e38 ergs/s (0.3-6 keV).

If a CMB map is contaminated by the SZ\neffect of galaxies or galaxy clusters, the CMB maps should have similar\nnon-Gaussian features as the galaxy and cluster fields. Using the WMAP data and\n2MASS galaxy catalog we show that the non-Gaussianity of the 2MASS galaxies is\nimprinted on WMAP maps. The signature of non-Gaussianity can be seen with the\n4^{th} order cross correlation between the wavelet variables of the WMAP maps\nand 2MASS clusters. The intensity of the 4^{th} order non-Gaussian features is\nfound to be consistent with the contamination of the SZ effect of 2MASS\ngalaxies. We also show that this non-Gaussianity can not be seen by the high\norder auto-correlation of the WMAP. This is because the SZ signals in the\nauto-correlations of the WMAP data generally is weaker than the WMAP-2MASS\ncross correlations by a factor f^2, which is the ratio between the powers of SZ\neffect map and the CMB fluctuations on the scale considered. Therefore, the\nratio of high order auto-correlations of CMB maps to cross-correlations of the\nCMB maps and galaxy field would be effective to constrain the powers of SZ\neffect on various scales.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 06\n"}

{"prompt": "  We present the results of HST observations of the host star for the first\ndefinitive extrasolar planet detected by microlensing. The light curve model\nfor this event predicts that the lens star should be separated from the source\nstar by ~6mas at the time of the HST images. If the lens star is a late G, K or\nearly M dwarf, then it will be visible in the HST images as an additional\nsource of light that is blended with the source image. Unless the lens and\nsource have exactly the same colors, its presence will also be revealed by a\nsystematic shift between centroids of the source plus lens in different filter\nbands. The HST data indicates both of these effects: the HST source that\nmatches the position of the source star is 0.21 magnitudes brighter in the\nACS/HRC-F814W filter than the microlensing model predicts, and there is an\noffset of ~0.7mas between the centroid of this source in the F814W and F435W\nfilter bands. We conclude the planetary host star has been detected in these\nHST images, and this identification of the lens star enables a complete\nsolution of the lens system. The lens parameters are determined with a Bayesian\nanalysis, averaging over uncertainties in the measured parameters, interstellar\nextinction, and allowing for the possibility of a binary companion to the\nsource star. This yields a stellar mass of M_* = 0.63(+0.07/-0.09) M_solar and\na planet mass of M_p = 2.6 (+0.8/-0.6) M_Jup at an orbital separation of 4.3\n(+2.5/-0.8) AU. Thus, the lens system resembles our own Solar System, with a\nplanet of ~3 Jupiter-masses in a Jupiter-like orbit around a star of two-thirds\nof a Solar mass.

{"prompt": "  In this paper, the physics of flow instability and turbulent transition in\nshear flows is studied by analyzing the energy variation of fluid particles\nunder the interaction of base flow with a disturbance. For the first time, a\nmodel derived strictly from physics is proposed to show that the flow\ninstability under finite amplitude disturbance leads to turbulent transition.\nThe proposed model is named as \"energy gradient method.\" It is demonstrated\nthat it is the transverse energy gradient that leads to the disturbance\namplification while the disturbance is damped by the energy loss due to\nviscosity along the streamline. It is also shown that the threshold of\ndisturbance amplitude obtained is scaled with the Reynolds number by an\nexponent of -1, which exactly explains the recent modern experimental results\nby Hof et al. for pipe flow. The mechanism for velocity inflection and hairpin\nvortex formation are explained with reference to analytical results. Following\nfrom this analysis, it can be demonstrated that the critical value of the so\ncalled energy gradient parameter Kmax is constant for turbulent transition in\nwall bounded parallel flows, and this is confirmed by experiments and is about\n370-389. The location of instability initiation in the flow field accords well\nwith the experiments for both pipe Poiseuille flow (r/R=0.58) and plane\nPoiseuille flow (y/h=0.58). It is also inferred from the proposed method that\nthe transverse energy gradient can serve as the power for the self-sustaining\nprocess of wall bounded turbulence.

{"prompt": "  Loop is a powerful program construct in classical computation, but its power\nis still not exploited fully in quantum computation. The exploitation of such\npower definitely requires a deep understanding of the mechanism of quantum loop\nprograms.

The notions of termination and almost\ntermination are proposed for quantum loops, and the function computed by a\nquantum loop is defined. To show their expressive power, quantum loops are\napplied in describing quantum walks. Necessary and sufficient conditions for\ntermination and almost termination of a general quantum loop on any mixed input\nstate are presented. A quantum loop is said to be (almost) terminating if it\n(almost) terminates on any input state. We show that a quantum loop is almost\nterminating if and only if it is uniformly almost terminating.

{"prompt": "  A continuum description of granular flows would be of considerable help in\npredicting natural geophysical hazards or in designing industrial processes.\nHowever, the constitutive equations for dry granular flows, which govern how\nthe material moves under shear, are still a matter of debate. One difficulty is\nthat grains can behave like a solid (in a sand pile), a liquid (when poured\nfrom a silo) or a gas (when strongly agitated). For the two extreme regimes,\nconstitutive equations have been proposed based on kinetic theory for\ncollisional rapid flows, and soil mechanics for slow plastic flows. However,\nthe intermediate dense regime, where the granular material flows like a liquid,\nstill lacks a unified view and has motivated many studies over the past decade.\nThe main characteristics of granular liquids are: a yield criterion (a critical\nshear stress below which flow is not possible) and a complex dependence on\nshear rate when flowing. In this sense, granular matter shares similarities\nwith classical visco-plastic fluids such as Bingham fluids. Here we propose a\nnew constitutive relation for dense granular flows, inspired by this analogy\nand recent numerical and experimental work. We then test our three-dimensional\n(3D) model through experiments on granular flows on a pile between rough\nsidewalls, in which a complex 3D flow pattern develops. We show that, without\nany fitting parameter, the model gives quantitative predictions for the flow\nshape and velocity profiles.

Yet, whether these \"Tidal Dwarf Galaxies\" (TDGs)\ncandidates are really long-lived and not only present in young interacting\nsystems is still an open question to which numerical simulations may give\nanswers. We present a set of 96 simulations of colliding galaxies with various\nmass ratios and encounter geometries, and statistically study the evolution of\ntheir TDG candidates. Among the 593 substructures initially identified in tidal\ntails, about 75% fall back onto their progenitor or are disrupted in a few 10^8\nyears. The remaining 25% become long-lived bound objects that typically survive\nmore than 2Gyr with masses above 10^8 M_sun.

LINERs\nare older, more massive, less dusty and more concentrated, and have higher\nvelocity dispersions and lower [OIII] luminosities than Seyfert galaxies. We\nconsider the quantity L[OIII]/sigma^4, which is an indicator of the black hole\naccretion rate relative to the Eddington rate. Remarkably, we find that at\nfixed L[OIII]/sigma^4, all differences between Seyfert and LINER host\nproperties disappear. LINERs and Seyferts form a continuous sequence, with\nLINERs dominant at low L/L(EDD) and Seyferts dominant at high L/L(EDD). These\nresults suggest that the majority of LINERs are AGN and that the Seyfert/LINER\ndichotomy is analogous to the high/low-state transition for X-ray binary\nsystems.

{"prompt": "  Algorithmic self-assembly, a generalization of crystal growth processes, has\nbeen proposed as a mechanism for autonomous DNA computation and for bottom-up\nfabrication of complex nanostructures. A `program' for growing a desired\nstructure consists of a set of molecular `tiles' designed to have specific\nbinding interactions. A key challenge to making algorithmic self-assembly\npractical is designing tile set programs that make assembly robust to errors\nthat occur during initiation and growth. One method for the controlled\ninitiation of assembly, often seen in biology, is the use of a seed or catalyst\nmolecule that reduces an otherwise large kinetic barrier to nucleation. Here we\nshow how to program algorithmic self-assembly similarly, such that seeded\nassembly proceeds quickly but there is an arbitrarily large kinetic barrier to\nunseeded growth. We demonstrate this technique by introducing a family of tile\nsets for which we rigorously prove that, under the right physical conditions,\nlinearly increasing the size of the tile set exponentially reduces the rate of\nspurious nucleation. Simulations of these `zig-zag' tile sets suggest that\nunder plausible experimental conditions, it is possible to grow large seeded\ncrystals in just a few hours such that less than 1 percent of crystals are\nspuriously nucleated. Simulation results also suggest that zig-zag tile sets\ncould be used for detection of single DNA strands. Together with prior work\nshowing that tile sets can be made robust to errors during properly initiated\ngrowth, this work demonstrates that growth of objects via algorithmic\nself-assembly can proceed both efficiently and with an arbitrarily low error\nrate, even in a model where local growth rules are probabilistic.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 06\n"}

The derived (12+log(O/H))\nvalues range from 8.4 to 9.0, with a median of 8.7. Twenty of these galaxies\nhave securely measured rotation velocities, in the range 50--244 km/s. The\nmeasured emission line equivalent widths and diagnostic ratios for the\nintermediate redshift galaxies cover similar ranges to those observed across a\nlarge sample of local galaxies. The estimated oxygen abundances for our\nluminous star-forming intermediate redshift galaxies cover the same range as\ntheir local counterparts. However, at a given galaxy luminosity, many of our\ngalaxies have significantly lower oxygen abundances, i.e., $(12+log(O/H))~8.6$,\nthan local galaxies with similar luminosities. Interestingly, these luminous,\nmassive, intermediate redshift, star-forming galaxies with low oxygen\nabundances exhibit physical conditions, i.e., emission line equivalent width\nand ionization state, very similar to those of local faint and metal-poor\nstar-forming galaxies. The oxygen abundance of the interstellar gas does not\nseem to correlate with the maximum rotation velocity or the emission scale\nlength of the parent galaxy.

The PDMF was parameterized as a power law in the available\nmain-sequence mass range of each cluster, typically 0.9 <~ m/M_sun <~ 2.5; its\nslope was determined at different positions spanning from the very centre out\nto several core radii. The CMDs in the central regions of the clusters were\ncarefully studied earlier, resulting in accurate age, metallicity, distance\nmodulus, and reddening values. The slope alpha (where Salpeter is 2.35) was\ndetermined in annuli by following two distinct methods: 1) a power law fit to\nthe PDMF obtained from the systemic luminosity function (LF); 2) a statistical\ncomparison between observed and model CMDs. In all clusters, significant mass\nsegregation is found from the positional dependence of the PDMF slope: alpha <~\n1.8 for R <= 1.0 R_core and alpha ~ Salpeter inside R=2~3 R_core (except for\nHodge 14, where alpha ~ Salpeter for R ~ 4 R_core). The results are robust in\nthe sense that they hold true for both methods used.
