{"prompt": "  Recently, there has been some interest for building supersymmetric models of\ndouble inflation. These models, realistic from a particle physics point of\nview, predict a broken-scale-invariant power spectrum of primordial\ncosmological perturbations, that may explain eventual non-trivial features in\nthe present matter power spectrum. In previous works, the primordial spectrum\nwas calculated using analytic slow-roll approximations. However, these models\ninvolve a fast second-order phase transition during inflation, with a stage of\nspinodal instability, and an interruption of slow-roll. For our previous model\nof double D-term inflation, we simulate numerically the evolution of quantum\nfluctuations, taking into account the spinodal modes, and we show that the\nsemi-classical approximation can be employed even during the transition, due to\nthe presence of a second inflaton field.

{"prompt": "  When a source star is gravitationally microlensed by a dark lens, the\ncentroid of the source star image is displaced relative to the position of the\nunlensed source star with an elliptical trajectory. Recently, routine\nastrometric follow-up measurements of these source star image centroid shifts\nby using high precision interferometers are proposed to measure the lens proper\nmotion which can resolve the lens parameter degeneracy in the photometrically\ndetermined Einstein time scale. When an event is caused by a bright lens, on\nthe other hand, the astrometric shift is affected by the light from the lens,\nbut one cannot identify the existence of the bright lens from the observed\ntrajectory because the resulting trajectory of the bright lens event is also an\nellipse. As results, lensing parameters determined from the trajectory differ\nfrom those of a dark lens event, causing wrong identification of lens\npopulation. In this paper, we show that although the shape and size of the\nastrometric centroid shift trajectory are changed due to the bright lens, the\nangular speed of centroid shifts around the apparent position of the unlensed\nsource star is not affected by the lens brightness. Then, one can identify the\nexistence of the bright lens and determine its brightness by comparing the lens\nparameters determined from the angular speed curve with those determined from\nthe trajectory of observed centroid shifts. Once the lens brightness is\ndetermined, one can correct for the lens proper motion.

At variance with\nprevious claims we find that these stars experience thermal instability (the so\ncalled thermal pulses). The critical quantity which controls the onset of a\nthermally pulsing phase is the amount of CNO in the envelope during the AGB.\nFor these stars the central He burning starts in the blue side of the HR\ndiagram and the 1^{st} dredge up does not take place. Then the envelope\nmaintains its initial composition up to the beginning of the AGB phase.\nHowever, during the early AGB the 2^{nd} dredge-up occurs and fresh He and CNO\nelements are engulfed in the convective envelope. We find that in stars with\nM.ge.6Mo the resulting amount of ^{12}C is large enough to sustain a normal CNO\nburning within the H shell and consequently the star enters the usual thermal\npulse phase. In the 5Mo model, owing to the lower ^{12}C enhancement in the\nenvelope after the 2^{nd} dredge-up, the He burning shell suffers weak thermal\ninstabilities. 9 of these thermal oscillation are needed before the He burning\nluminosity reaches 3x10^5 Lo and a first convective shell develops in between\nthe two burning shells.

If the gas\ntraces the dark matter to overdensities of order 10, as expected from\nsimulations, this effect is at least comparable to the Vishniac effect at\narcminute scales. On smaller scales, it may be used to study the thermal\nhistory-dependent clustering of the gas. Polarization is generated through\nThomson scattering of primordial quadrupole anisotropies, kinetic (second order\nDoppler) quadrupole anisotropies and intrinsic scattering quadrupole\nanisotropies. Small scale polarization results from the density and ionization\nmodulation of these sources. These effects generically produce comparable E and\nB-parity polarization, but of negligible amplitude (0.001-0.01 uK) in adiabatic\nCDM models. However, the primordial and kinetic quadrupoles are observationally\ncomparable today so that a null detection of B-polarization would set\nconstraints on the evolution and coherence of the velocity field.

Our simulations point to an existence of a high-energy tail\nof accelerated electrons with a Lorentz factor of more than $700\\Gamma_0$.\nLarge-amplitude electromagnetic waves are generated by the oscillating currents\nat the wind front. The mean field of these waves ahead of the wind front is an\norder of magnitude less than the magnetic field of the wind. High-energy\nelectrons which are accelerated at the wind front and injected into the region\nahead of the front generate synchro-Compton radiation in the fields of\nlarge-amplitude electromagnetic waves. This radiation closely resembles\nsynchrotron radiation and can reproduce the non-thermal radiation of gamma-ray\nbursts observed in the Ginga and BATSE ranges (from a few keV to a few MeV).\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 99\n"}

The best DCC signal is expected for initial conditions centered\naround $<\\sigma > \\approx 0 $ as would be the case of effective light `pions'\nclose to the phase transition. By choosing appropriate idealized global\nparameters for the expansion our findings show that an experimentally feasible\nDCC, if it does exist in nature, has to be a rare event with some finite\nprobability following a nontrivial and nonpoissonian distribution on an event\nby event basis. DCCs might then be identified experimentally by inspecting\nhigher order factorial cumulants $\\theta_m$ ($m\\ge 3$) in the sampled\ndistribution.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 99\n"}

I first examine\nthe role of the dust opacity in the optical band on the appearance of\nproto-PNs. I conclude that large optical depth will be found in proto-PNs which\nare descendant of AGB stars having high equatorial mass loss rates, which\nrequire a stellar binary companion for their existence. These proto-PNs will\nbecome bipolar-PNs, i.e., PNs with two lobes an an equatorial waist between\nthem, or extreme elliptical PNs.

The ionization will proceed faster in\nthe radial direction along low density regions. The low density regions will be\nheated earlier, and they will expand due to their higher pressures, reducing\nfurther their densities.

{"prompt": "  The Hall coefficient (R_H) of high-Tc cuprates in the normal state shows the\nstriking non-Fermi liquid behavior: R_H follows a Curie-Weiss type temperature\ndependence, and |R_H|>>1/|ne| at low temperatures in the under-doped compounds.\nMoreover, R_H is positive for hole-doped compounds and is negative for\nelectron-doped ones, although each of them has a similar hole-like Fermi\nsurface. In this paper, we give the explanation of this long-standing problem\nfrom the standpoint of the nearly antiferromagnetic (AF) Fermi liquid. We\nconsider seriously the vertex corrections for the current which are\nindispensable to satisfy the conservation laws, which are violated within the\nconventional Boltzmann transport approximation. The obtained total current J_k\ntakes an enhanced value and is no more perpendicular to the Fermi surface due\nto the strong AF fluctuations. By virtue of this mechanism, the anomalous\nbehavior of R_H in high-Tc cuprates is neutrally explained. We find that both\nthe temperature and the (electron, or hole) doping dependences of R_H in\nhigh-T_c cuprates are reproduced well by numerical calculations based on the\nfluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approximation, applied to the single-band Hubbard\nmodel. We also discuss the temperature dependence of R_H in other nearly AF\nmetals, e.g., V_2O_3, kappa-BEDT-TTF organic superconductors, and heavy fermion\nsystems close to the AF phase boundary.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 99\n"}

{"prompt": "  Motivated by the recent experimental announcements for direct measurements of\ntime-reversal non-invariance in the neutral kaon system, we make a comparative\ndiscussion of the CPLEAR and KTeV measurements. The most suitable way to\nconsistently incorporate the mixing, the time evolution and the decays of\nkaons, is to describe the neutral kaon system as a system with a non-Hermitean\nHamiltonian. In this framework, the physical (decaying) incoming and outgoing\nstates are distinct and belong to dual spaces. Moreover, since they are\neigenstates of the full Hamiltonian, they never oscillate. This is directly\nmanifest in the orthogonality conditions of the physical states, which entirely\ndetermine the evolution of the kaon system. Along these lines we conclude:\nCPLEAR studies K0-bar{K0} oscillations, a process where initial and final\nstates can be reversed, the CPLEAR asymmetry being an effect directly related\nto the definition of time-reversal. Conclusively, CPLEAR provides a direct\nmeasurement of T-violation without any assumption either on unitarity or on\nCPT-invariance. The KTeV experiment studies in particular the process KL -> pi+\npi- e+ e- where they measure a T-odd effect.

{"prompt": "  The downward acceleration of the virtual electrically charged fermion\nparticles of the quantum vacuum is responsible for the Einstein Weak\nEquivalence Principle and for our perception of 4D space-time curvature near\nthe earth. Since the virtual fermion particles of the quantum vacuum (virtual\nelectrons for example) possess mass, we assume that during their short\nlifetimes the virtual fermions are in a state of downward acceleration (or\nfree-fall) near the earth. Many of the virtual fermions also possess electrical\ncharge, and are thus capable of interacting electrically with a real test mass,\nsince a test mass is composed of real, electrically charged, fermion particles.\nThe electrical interaction between the downward accelerated virtual fermions\nwith nearby light or matter is responsible for the equivalence of inertial and\ngravitational mass, and also responsible for our perception of 4D space-time\ncurvature near the earth. In pure accelerated frames the apparent acceleration\nof the virtual particles of the quantum vacuum is caused by the actual\naccelerated motion of a test mass. An opposition to acceleration is felt by the\nmass that is proportional to the magnitude of the mass, according to F=MA. This\nprocess is responsible for inertia, and the exact reverse process is\nresponsible for the magnitude of the gravitational mass.

At larger\nradii, the phase space in triaxial potentials is complex, consisting of\nstochastic orbits as well as regular orbits associated with stable resonances.\nFigure rotation tends to increase the degree of stochasticity. Both\ntest-particle integrations and N-body simulations suggest that a triaxial\ngalaxy responds globally to the presence of a central mass concentration by\nevolving toward more axisymmetric shapes; the evolution occurs rapidly when the\nmass of the central object exceeds roughly 2% of the mass in stars. The lack of\nsignificant triaxiality in most early-type galaxies may be a consequence of\norbital evolution induced by nuclear black holes.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 99\n"}

The ratio is given as a function of a disc\npotential parameter, kappa/Omega, where kappa and Omega are the epicycle and\ncircular frequencies (the parameters kappa/Omega=1 and 2 correspond to Kepler\nrotation and solid-body rotation). For 1 <= kappa/Omega <~ 1.5, the velocity\ndispersion increases keeping some anisotropy (sigma_z / sigma_R ~ 0.5-0.7) if\nthe amplitude of radial excursion is larger than tidal radius, while sigma_z /\nsigma_R << 1 for smaller amplitude.

This paper considers mainly theta-solvents, and we\ncalculate the dynamic charge density correlation function g(k,t) in the\ninterior of the globules, using the quadratic approximation to the\nMartin-Siggia-Rose generating functional. It is convenient to express the\nresults in terms of dimensionless space and time variables. Let R be the blob\nsize, and let T be the characteristic time scale at the blob level. Define the\ndimensionless wave vector q = R k, and the dimensionless time s = t/T. We find\nthat for q<1, corresponding to length scales larger than the blob size, the\ncharge density fluctuations relax according to g(q,s) = q^2(1-s^(1/2)) at short\ntimes s < 1, and according to g(q,s) = q^2 s^(-1/2) at intermediate times 1 < s\n< q^(-4). We expect these results to be valid for wave vectors q > 0.1, where\nentanglements are unimportant.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 99\n"}

However, the results of such an analysis always yield a\nstrong degeneracy between the mass density profile and the velocity dispersion\nanisotropy profile. Here we analyze the full (R,v) dataset of galaxy positions\nand velocities in an attempt to break this degeneracy. We build an `ensemble\ncluster' from the individual clusters under the assumption that they form a\nhomologous sequence. To interpret the data we study a one-parameter family of\nspherical models with different constant velocity dispersion anisotropy.

Although the results of our analysis depend slightly\non which statistic is used to judge the models, all statistics agree that the\nbest-fit model is close to isotropic. This result derives primarily from the\nfact that the observed grand-total velocity histogram is close to Gaussian,\nwhich is not expected to be the case for a strongly anisotropic model.

The model\nis derived from equilibrium statistical mechanics by using a mean-field\napproximation of the conserved Hamiltonian and particle number for\nfinite-dimensional spectral truncations of the NLS dynamics. The continuum\nlimits of these approximated statistical equilibrium ensembles on\nfinite-dimensional phase spaces are analyzed, holding the energy and particle\nnumber at fixed, finite values. The analysis shows that the coherent structure\nminimizes total energy for a given value of particle number and hence is a\nsolution to the NLS ground state equation, and that the remaining energy\nresides in Gaussian fluctuations equipartitioned over wavenumbers. Some results\nof direct numerical integration of the NLS equation are included to validate\nempirically these properties of the most probable states for the statistical\nmodel. Moreover, a theoretical justification of the mean-field approximation is\ngiven, in which the approximate ensembles are shown to concentrate on the\nassociated microcanonical ensemble in the continuum limit.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 99\n"}

The\nresummation is potentially important since these logs turn into\nlog(2E_{cut}/m_b), when the rate is integrated from the lower cut\nx=2E_{cut}/m_b to 1. The resummed rate is then convolved with models for the\nstructure function to study whether or not the logs will be enhanced due to the\nfermi motion of the heavy quark.

The H-band magnitude corrected for\nextinction and the infrared Tully-Fisher relation are then used to estimate a\ndistance modulus of (m-M)_0 = 28.62+/-0.27, and thus a distance of d = 5.3\n{+0.7/-0.6} Mpc, which puts Dw1 at the far end of the IC342/Maffei 1 & 2 group.\nOur result is largely independent of the nature of the reddening law because we\nestimated both the reddening and the distance at the same wavelength range.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 99\n"}

The observations show RX Pup\nunderwent a nova-like eruption during the last three decades. The hot component\ncontracted in radius at roughly constant luminosity from 1975 to 1986, and was\nthe source of a strong stellar wind which prevented it from accreting material\nlost in the Mira wind. Around 1988/9 the hot component turned over in the HR\ndiagram and by 1991 its luminosity had faded by a factor of about 30 with\nrespect to the maximum plateau value and the hot wind had practically ceased.\nBy 1995 the nova remnant started to accrete material from the Mira wind, as\nindicated by a general increase in intensity of the optical continuum and HI\nemission. The quiescent spectrum resembles the quiescent spectra of symbiotic\nrecurrent novae, and its intensity indicates the hot component must accrete as\nmuch as about 1 per cent of the Mira wind, which is more or less the amount\npredicted by Bondi-Hoyle theory.

{"prompt": "  X-ray observations of blazars associated with the OVV (Optically Violently\nVariable) quasars put strong constraints on the electron - positron pair\ncontent of radio-loud quasar jets. From those observations, we infer that jets\nin quasars contain many more electron - positron pairs than protons, but\ndynamically are still dominated by protons. In particular, we show that pure\nelectron - positron jet models can be excluded, as they overpredict soft X-ray\nradiation; likewise, pure proton - electron jets can be excluded, as they\npredict too weak nonthermal X-ray radiation. An intermediate case is viable. We\ndemonstrate that jets which are initially proton-electron (\"proto-jets\") can be\npair-loaded via interaction with 100 - 300 keV photons produced in hot\naccretion disc coronae, likely to exist in active galactic nuclei in general.\nIf the coronal radiation is powered by magnetic flares, the pair loading is\nexpected to be non-uniform and non-axisymmetric. Together with radiation drag,\nthis leads to velocity and density perturbations in a jet and formation of\nshocks, where the pairs are accelerated. Such a scenario can explain rapid\n(time scale of about a day) variability observed in OVV quasars.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 99\n"}

This method, called\nZTRACE, is based on a self-consistent solution of the growing mode of\ngravitational instabilities according to the Zel'dovich approximation and\nhigher order in Lagrangian perturbation theory. Given the evolved\nredshift-space density field, smoothed on some scale, ZTRACE finds via an\niterative procedure, an approximation to the initial density field for any\ngiven set of cosmological parameters; real-space densities and peculiar\nvelocities are also reconstructed. The method is tested by applying it to\nN-body simulations of an Einstein-de Sitter and an open cold dark matter\nuniverse. It is shown that errors in the estimate of the density contrast\ndominate the noise of the reconstruction. As a consequence, the reconstruction\nof real space density and peculiar velocity fields using non-linear algorithms\nis little improved over those based on linear theory. The use of a\nmass-preserving adaptive smoothing, equivalent to a smoothing in Lagrangian\nspace, allows an unbiased (although noisy) reconstruction of initial\nconditions, as long as the (linearly extrapolated) density contrast does not\nexceed unity. The probability distribution function of the initial conditions\nis recovered to high precision, even for Gaussian smoothing scales of ~ 5\nMpc/h, except for the tail at delta >~ 1.

{"prompt": "  As a step toward elucidating the physical conditions in nearby active\ngalaxies, this paper presents spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of a sample\nof seven low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs). SEDs for four objects\nare presented for the first time (NGC 4261, NGC 4579, NGC 6251, and M84); the\ndata for the remaining three (M81, M87, and NGC 4594) have been substantially\nupdated compared to previous studies. The nuclear fluxes were carefully\nselected so as to avoid contamination by emission from the host galaxy, which\ncan be substantial for very weak nuclei. The present sample of low-luminosity\nnuclei all exhibit SEDs that look markedly different from the canonical\nbroad-band continuum spectrum of luminous AGNs. The most striking difference is\nthat the low-luminosity objects lack an ultraviolet excess (the \"big blue\nbump\"), a feature normally associated with emission from a standard optically\nthick, geometrically thin accretion disk. The weakness of the ultraviolet band\nleads to an unusually steep optical-ultraviolet continuum shape and a more\npronounced contribution from the X-rays to the ionizing spectrum. It is argued\nthat the absence of the big blue bump is a property intrinsic to the SEDs and\nnot an artifact of strong dust extinction. The integrated spectra confirm the\nexceptional weakness of the nuclei: the bolometric luminosities range from\n2E+41 to 8E+42 erg/s, or 10^-6 to 10-3 times the Eddington rate for the black\nhole masses previously reported for these galaxies.

We formulate an\ninformation-theoretic conjecture about decoherence due to an environment: the\nnumber of bits required to describe a set of decoherent histories is\napproximately equal to the number of bits of information thrown away to the\nenvironment in the coarse-graining process.

{"prompt": "  If, as recently reported by the Super-Kamiokande collaboration, the neutrinos\nare massive, the heaviest one would not be stable and, though chargeless, could\nin particular decay into a lighter neutrino and a photon by quantum loop\neffects. The corresponding rate is computed in the standard model with massive\nDirac neutrinos as a function of the neutrino masses and mixing angles. The\nlifetime of the decaying neutrino is estimated to be approximately 10^44 years\nfor a mass 5 10^{-2} eV. If kinematically possible, the decay of a heavy\nneutrino into a lighter one plus an e+ e- pair occurs at tree level and its\none-loop radiative corrections get enhanced by a large logarithm of the\nelectron mass acting as an infrared cutoff. It then largely dominates the\nphotonic mode by several orders of magnitude, corresponding to a lifetime\napproximately equal to 10^{-2} year for a mass 1.1 MeV.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 99\n"}

{"prompt": "  We consider the explosion of supernovae and the possible production of a\nvariety of high energy transients by delayed black hole formation in massive\nstars endowed with rotation. Following the launch of a ``successful'' shock by\nthe usual neutrino powered mechanism, the inner layers of the star move\noutwards, but lack adequate energy to eject all the matter exterior to the\nneutron star. Over a period of minutes to hours a variable amount of mass,\nabout 0.1 to 5 solar masses falls back into the collapsed remnant, often\nturning it into a black hole and establishing an accretion disk. The accretion\nrate, about 0.001 to 0.01 solar masses per second, is inadequate to produce a\njet mediated by neutrino annihilation, but similar to that invoked in\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We thus consider\nthe effect of jets formed by ``fallback'' in stars that are already in the\nprocess of exploding. We justify a parameterization of the jet power as a\nconstant times the mass accretion rate, $\\epsilon \\dot {\\rm M} c^2$, and\nexplore the consequences of $\\epsilon$ = 0.001 and 0.01. In supergiants, shock\nbreakout produces bright x-ray transients that might be a diagnostic of the\nmodel. Jets produced by fallback should be more frequent than those made by the\nprompt formation of a black hole and may power the most common form of\ngamma-ray transient in the universe, although not the most common form seen so\nfar by BATSE. Those are still attributed to prompt black hole formation, but it\nmay be that the diverse energies observed for GRBs so far reflect chiefly the\nvariable collimation of the jet inside the star and a consequently highly\nvariable fraction of relativistic ejecta. Indeed, these events may all have a\ncommon total energy near 10$^{52}$ erg.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 99\n"}
