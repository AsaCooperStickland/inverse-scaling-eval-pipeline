The afterglow\nobserved in the last few years enabled redshift determination for a handful of\nbursts, and the cosmological origin is now firmly established. Though the\ndistance scale is settled, there still remains orders of magnitude uncertainty\nin their rate and in the total energy that is released in the explosion due to\nthe possibility that the emission is not spherical but jet-like. Contrary to\nthe GRB itself, the afterglow can be measured up to months and even years after\nthe burst, and it can provide crucial information on the geometry of the\nejecta. We review the theory of afterglow from jets and discuss the evidence\nthat at least some of the bursts are not spherical.

{"prompt": "  We analyze the three catalogs of nearby loose groups identified by Garcia\n(1993). She used a percolation and a hierarchical method, and proposed a third\ngroup catalog defined as a combination of the two. Each catalog contains almost\n500 groups. In agreement with previous works on earlier catalogs, we find that\ngroups can be described as collapsing systems. Their sampled size is much\nlarger than their expected virialized region. We compute the virial masses and\ncorrect them by taking into account the young dynamical status. We estimate\ngroup masses, M, for two cosmological models, a flat one with Omega_0=1 and an\nopen one with Omega_0=0.2. For each of the three catalogs we calculate the mass\nfunction, MF. The number density of groups with M>9x10^{12}\\msun, which is the\nadopted limit of sample completeness, ranges within 1.3-1.9x10^{-3}h^3/Mpc^3\nfor Omega_0=1, and it is about a factor of 15% lower for Omega_0=0.2. The MFs\nof the hierarchical and combined catalogs have essentially the same shape,\nwhile the MF of the percolation catalog shows a flattening towards large\nmasses. However, the difference decreases if we do not consider the most\nmassive groups, for which reliable results come from galaxy cluster studies.\nAfter having estimated the mass contained within the central, presumably\nvirialized, regions of groups by adopting a reduction in mass of 30-40%, we do\na comparison with the results coming from the virial analysis of nearby rich\nclusters (Girardi et al. 1998). All three group MFs turn out to be a smooth\nextrapolation of the cluster MF at M<4x10^{14}\\msun, which is the completeness\nlimit of the cluster sample. The resulting optical virial MF of galaxy systems,\nwhich extends over two orders of magnitude, is fitted to a Schechter expression\nwith a slope of about -1.5 and a characteristic mass of about 3x10^{14}\\msun.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20as"}

We will show that the presence of nodal lines can account for observed\n180 degree phase jumps in drifting subpulses and their otherwise poor phase\nstability, even if the time-like oscillations are strictly periodic. Our model\ncan also account for the \"mode changes\" and \"nulls\" observed in some pulsars as\nquasiperiodic changes between pulsation modes of different l or radial overtone\nn, analogous to pulsation mode changes observed in oscillating white dwarf\nstars. We will discuss other definitive and testable requirements of our model\nand show that they are qualitatively supported by existing data.

For our calculations we assume that equal mass\nstars form rapidly in a tidally truncated gas cloud, that $\\sim10$\\% of the\nstars are in binaries and that the resulting star cluster undergoes an epoch of\nviolent relaxation. We study the collisional interaction of the binaries and\nsingle stars, in particular, the ionization of the binaries and the energy\nexchange between binaries and single stars. We find that for large $N$ systems\n($N > 10^3$) even the most violent beginning leaves the binary distribution\nfunction largely intact.

{"prompt": "  A new method for measuring the shear induced by gravitational light\ndeflection is proposed. It is based on analyzing the anisotropy induced in the\nauto-correlation function (ACF) of the extragalactic background light which is\nproduced by very faint distant galaxies. The ACF can be measured `locally', and\nits anisotropy is caused by the tidal gravitational field of the deflecting\nmass distribution in the foreground of these faint background galaxies. Since\nthe method does not require individual galaxy detection, it can be used to\nmeasure the shear of extremely faint galaxies which are not detectable\nindividually, but are present in the noise. The shear estimated from the ACF of\nthe noise provides an independent measurement which can be compared to the\nshear obtained from the distortion of individual galaxy images. Combining these\ntwo independent estimates clearly increases the sensitivity of shear\nmeasurements. In addition, our method may allow to determine the local\nmagnification caused by the deflector if the auto-correlation function is\ncaused by a large number density of faint galaxies; in this case, the intrinsic\nACF may provide a `standard source' with respect to which shear and\nmagnification can be obtained. Applications to real and synthetic data are\nshown and the feasibility of our new method is demonstrated. In particular, we\npresent the shear maps obtained with our method for the double QSO 2345+007 and\nthe cluster Cl0024+16 and compare them to published shear maps.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20as"}
