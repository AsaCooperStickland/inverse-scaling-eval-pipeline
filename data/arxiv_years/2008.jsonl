{"prompt": "  We address the origin of the `downsizing' of elliptical galaxies, according\nto which the stars in more massive galaxies formed earlier and over a shorter\nperiod than those in less massive galaxies. We show that this could be the\nnatural result of a shutdown of star formation in dark matter haloes above a\ncritical mass of 10^12MSun. This is demonstrated using a semianalytic\nsimulation of galaxy formation within the standard hierarchical scenario of\nstructure formation. The assumed threshold mass is motivated by the prediction\nof stable shock heating above this mass and the finding that such a shutdown\nreproduces the observed distribution of galaxies in luminosity and colour.The\nshutdown at a critical halo mass introduces a characteristic stellar mass for\nthe transition of galaxies into the `red sequence' of the galaxy\ncolour-magnitude diagram. Central galaxies of haloes that are more massive\ntoday have reached this mass earlier and can therefore grow further along the\nred sequence by dry mergers, ending up more massive and containing older stars.\nSmall galaxies formed in haloes below the critical mass can shutdown late, when\nthey fall into haloes above the critical mass and become satellites. While our\nsemianalytic simulation that incorporates an explicit shutdown reproduces\ndownsizing as inferred from the stellar ages of ellipticals, we explain why it\nis much harder to detect downsizing using the mass functions of different\ngalaxy types.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2008"}

Motivated by previous studies on spacetimes emerging from a\nmicroscopic substrate, we show how these modifications naturally lead to\nmomentum-dependent rainbow metrics. Firstly, we investigate the possibility of\nreproducing cosmological particle production in spacetimes emerging from real\nBose gases.

We first study the characteristics of the simulation and\nhighlight the mass distribution within the galactic halo. The general dark\nmatter density has a typical $r^{-3}$ power law for large radii, but the inner\nbehaviour is poorly constrained below the resolution of the simulation ($\\sim\n200$ pc). We identify clumps and subclumps and analyze their distribution, as\nwell as their internal structure. Inside the clumps, the power law is rather\nuniversal, $r^{-2.5}$ in the outer part with again strong uncertainties for\nsmaller radii, especially for light clumps. We show a full-sky map of the\nastrophysical contribution to the gamma-ray or neutrino fluxes in this N-body\nframework. Using quite model independent and general assumptions for the high\nenergy physics part, we evaluate the possible absolute fluxes and show some\nbenchmark regions for the experiments GLAST, EGRET, and a km3 size extension of\nANTARES like the KM3NeT project. While individual clumps seem to be beyond\ndetection reach, the galactic center region is promising and GLAST could be\nsensitive to the geometry and the structure of its dark matter distribution.\nThe detection by a km3 version of ANTARES is, however, more challenging due to\na higher energy threshold. We also point out that the lack of resolution leaves\nthe inner structure of subhalos poorly constrained.

These so-called\nultra compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) constitute a transition between classical\nstar clusters and elliptical galaxies in terms of radii, relaxation times and\nV-band mass-to-light (M/L_V) ratios. Using new data, we find that the mass\ninterval from 10^6 to 10^7 M_sun is of special interest, because within this\nrange typical half-light radii and dynamical mass-to-light ratios begin to\nincrease compared to globular clusters, the highest stellar densities are\nreached and typical median two-body relaxation times surpass a Hubble time. The\nM/L_V ratios of the UCDs turn out to be incompatible with the predictions from\nsimple stellar population (SSP) models when using the canonical stellar initial\nmass function (IMF), although SSPs probably are good approximations to the real\nstellar populations in UCDs and the SSP models allow to account for metallicity\neffects on the M/L_V ratio. This provides evidence for the UCDs either having\nformed with an IMF different from the canonical one or containing dark matter.\nWe emphasise that almost all pressure-supported stellar systems ranging from\nstar clusters to massive elliptical galaxies have M/L_V ratios less than 10\nM_sun/L_sun, and that only dSph satellite galaxies have M/L_V ratios greater\nthan 100 M_sun/L_sun and therewith form exceptional systems.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2008"}

These blue outliers turn out\nto be important test-beds for models of the narrow-line region (NLR), for\nmechanisms of driving large-scale outflows, for links between NLS1 galaxies and\nradio galaxies, and for orientation-dependent NLS1 models.

All [OIII] blue outliers have narrow widths of\ntheir broad Balmer lines and high Eddington ratios.

{"prompt": "  We report the measurement of electron neutrino elastic scattering from 8B\nsolar neutrinos with 3 MeV energy threshold by the Borexino detector in Gran\nSasso (Italy). The rate of solar neutrino-induced electron scattering events\nabove this energy in Borexino is 0.217 +- 0.038 (stat) +- 0.008 (syst) cpd/100\nt, which corresponds to the equivalent unoscillated flux of (2.4 +- 0.4 (stat)\n+- 0.1 (syst))x10^6 cm^-2 s^-1, in good agreement with measurements from SNO\nand SuperKamiokaNDE. Assuming the 8B neutrino flux predicted by the high\nmetallicity Standard Solar Model, the average 8B neutrino survival probability\nabove 3 MeV is measured to be 0.29+-0.10. The survival probabilities for 7Be\nand 8B neutrinos as measured by Borexino differ by 1.9 sigma. These results are\nconsistent with the prediction of the MSW-LMA solution of a transition in the\nsolar electron neutrino survival probability between the low energy\nvacuum-driven and the high-energy matter-enhanced solar neutrino oscillation\nregimes.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2008"}

{"prompt": "  When the accretion rate is more than a small fraction of Eddington, the inner\nregions of accretion disks around black holes are expected to be\nradiation-dominated. However, in the alpha-model, these regions are also\nexpected to be thermally unstable. In this paper, we report two 3-d radiation\nMHD simulations of a vertically-stratified shearing box in which the ratio of\nradiation to gas pressure is ~ 10, and yet no thermal runaway occurs over a\ntimespan ~ 40 cooling times. Where the time-averaged dissipation rate is\ngreater than the critical dissipation rate that creates hydrostatic equilibrium\nby diffusive radiation flux, the time-averaged radiation flux is held to the\ncritical value, with the excess dissipated energy transported by radiative\nadvection. Although the stress and total pressure are well-correlated as\npredicted by the alpha-model, we show that stress fluctuations precede pressure\nfluctuations, contrary to the usual supposition that the pressure controls the\nsaturation level of the magnetic energy. This fact explains the thermal\nstability. Using a simple toy-model, we show that independently-generated\nmagnetic fluctuations can drive radiation pressure fluctuations, creating a\ncorrelation between the two while maintaining thermal stability.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2008"}

We consider a homogeneous (without particle\naggregates) ferrofluid consisting of identical spherical particles and employ a\nrigid dipole model, where magnetic moment of a particle is fixed with respect\nto the particle itself. In particular, for the magnetization relaxation after\nthe external field is instantly switched off, we show that the magnetodipolar\ninteraction leads to the increase of the initial magnetization relaxation time.\nFor the complex ac-susceptibility we find that the this interaction leads to an\noverall increase of the imaginary susceptibility part and shifts the peak on\nits frequency dependence towards lower frequencies. Comparing results obtained\nwith our analytical approach (second order virial expansion) to numerical\nsimulation data (Langevin dynamics method), we demonstrate that the employed\nvirial expansion approximation gives a good qualitative description of the\nferrofluid magnetization dynamics and provides a satisfactory quantitative\nagreement with numerical simulations for the dc magnetization relaxation - up\nto the particle volume fraction c ~ 10% and for the ac-susceptibility - up to c\n~ 5 %.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2008"}

{"prompt": "  Under two different scenarios for the light scalar mesons, we investigate the\ntransition form factors of $B(B_s)$ mesons decay into a scalar meson in the\nperturbative QCD approach. In the large recoiling region, the form factors are\ndominated by the short-distance dynamics and can be calculated using\nperturbation theory. We adopt the dipole parametrization to recast the $q^2$\ndependence of the form factors. Since the decay constants defined by the scalar\ncurrent are large, our predictions on the $B\\to S$ form factors are much larger\nthan the $B\\to P$ transitions, especially in the second scenario. Contributions\nfrom various light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) are elaborated and we\nfind that the twist-3 LCDAs provide more than a half contributions to the form\nfactors. The two terms of the twist-2 LCDAs give destructive contributions in\nthe first scenario while they give constructive contributions in the second\nscenario.

{"prompt": "  Butanol, an alcohol which can be produced from biomass sources, has received\nrecent interest as an alternative to gasoline for use in spark ignition engines\nand as a possible blending compound with fossil diesel or biodiesel.

Ignition delay times for\nbutanol/oxygen/argon mixtures have been measured behind reflected shock waves\nat temperatures and pressures ranging from approximately 1200 to 1800 K and 1\nto 4 bar. Electronically excited OH emission and pressure measurements were\nused to determine ignition delay times. A detailed kinetic mechanism has been\ndeveloped to describe the oxidation of the butanol isomers and validated by\ncomparison to the shock tube measurements. Reaction flux and sensitivity\nanalysis indicate that the consumption of 1 butanol and iso-butanol, the most\nreactive isomers, takes place primarily by H-atom abstraction resulting in the\nformation of radicals, the decomposition of which yields highly reactive\nbranching agents, H-atoms and OH radicals. Conversely, the consumption of tert\nbutanol and 2-butanol, the least reactive isomers, takes place primarily via\ndehydration, resulting in the formation of alkenes, which lead to resonance\nstabilized radicals with very low reactivity.

{"prompt": "  The association of an electromagnetic signal with the merger of a pair of\nsupermassive black holes would have many important implications. For example,\nit would provide new information about gas and magnetic field interactions in\ndynamical spacetimes as well as a combination of redshift and luminosity\ndistance that would enable precise cosmological tests. A proposal first made by\nBode & Phinney (2007) is that because radiation of gravitational waves during\nthe final inspiral and merger of the holes is abrupt and decreases the mass of\nthe central object by a few percent, there will be waves in the disk that can\nsteepen into shocks and thus increase the disk luminosity in a characteristic\nway. We evaluate this process analytically and numerically. We find that shocks\nonly occur when the fractional mass loss exceeds the half-thickness (h/r) of\nthe disk, hence significant energy release only occurs for geometrically thin\ndisks which are thus at low Eddington ratios. This strongly limits the\neffective energy release, and in fact our simulations show that the natural\nvariations in disk luminosity are likely to obscure this effect entirely.\nHowever, we demonstrate that the reduction of luminosity caused by the retreat\nof the inner edge of the disk following mass loss is potentially detectable.\nThis decrease occurs even if the disk is geometrically thick, and lasts for a\nduration on the order of the viscous time of the modified disk.\nObservationally, the best prospect for detection would be a sensitive future\nX-ray instrument with a field of view of on the order of a square degree, or\npossibly a wide-field radio array such as the Square Kilometer Array, if the\ndisk changes produce or interrupt radio emission from a jet.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2008"}
