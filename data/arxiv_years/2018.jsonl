{"prompt": "  Quantized maximum a posteriori (Q-MAP) is a recently-proposed Bayesian\ncompressed sensing algorithm that, given the source distribution, recovers\n$X^n$ from its linear measurements $Y^m=AX^n$, where $A\\in R^{m\\times n}$\ndenotes the known measurement matrix. On the other hand, Lagrangian minimum\nentropy pursuit (L-MEP) is a universal compressed sensing algorithm that aims\nat recovering $X^n$ from its linear measurements $Y^m=AX^n$, without having\naccess to the source distribution. Both Q-MAP and L-MEP provably achieve the\nminimum required sampling rates, in noiseless cases where such fundamental\nlimits are known. L-MEP is based on minimizing a cost function that consists of\na linear combination of the conditional empirical entropy of a potential\nreconstruction vector and its corresponding measurement error. In this paper,\nusing a first-order linear approximation of the conditional empirical entropy\nfunction, L-MEP is connected with Q-MAP. The established connection between\nL-MEP and Q-MAP leads to variants of Q-MAP which have the same asymptotic\nperformance as Q-MAP in terms of their required sampling rates. Moreover, these\nvariants suggest that Q-MAP is robust to small error in estimating the source\ndistribution. This robustness is theoretically proven and the effect of a\nnon-vanishing estimation error on the required sampling rate is characterized.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2018"}

At high gas pressures, when the backward\nRaman gain is comparable with, but lower than, the forward gain, we report\nquantum conversion efficiencies exceeding 40% to the backward Stokes at 683 nm\nfrom a narrowband 532-nm-pump.

When the diffusion coefficient is heterogeneous, this\nadds to the computational costs, and this difficulty is compounded by a\nsingular source term. For singular source terms, the solution does not belong\nto the Sobolev space $H^1$, but to the space $W^{1,p}$ for some $p<2$. Hence,\nthe problem may be reformulated in a distance-weighted Sobolev space. Using\nthis formulation, we develop a method to upscale the multiscale coefficient\nnear the singular sources by incorporating corrections into the coarse-grid.\nUsing a sub-grid correction method, we correct the basis functions in a\ndistance-weighted Sobolev space and show that these corrections can be\ntruncated to design a computationally efficient scheme with optimal convergence\nrates. Due to the nature of the formulation in weighted spaces, the variational\nform must be posed on the cross product of complementary spaces.

{"prompt": "  Though quite challenging, leveraging large-scale unlabeled or partially\nlabeled images in a cost-effective way has increasingly attracted interests for\nits great importance to computer vision. To tackle this problem, many Active\nLearning (AL) methods have been developed. However, these methods mainly define\ntheir sample selection criteria within a single image context, leading to the\nsuboptimal robustness and impractical solution for large-scale object\ndetection. In this paper, aiming to remedy the drawbacks of existing AL\nmethods, we present a principled Self-supervised Sample Mining (SSM) process\naccounting for the real challenges in object detection. Specifically, our SSM\nprocess concentrates on automatically discovering and pseudo-labeling reliable\nregion proposals for enhancing the object detector via the introduced cross\nimage validation, i.e., pasting these proposals into different labeled images\nto comprehensively measure their values under different image contexts. By\nresorting to the SSM process, we propose a new AL framework for gradually\nincorporating unlabeled or partially labeled data into the model learning while\nminimizing the annotating effort of users. Extensive experiments on two public\nbenchmarks clearly demonstrate our proposed framework can achieve the\ncomparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods with significantly fewer\nannotations.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2018"}

We present a new class of\noptimization methods, valid for any optimization problem setup on the space of\ndiffeomorphisms by generalizing Nesterov accelerated optimization to the\nmanifold of diffeomorphisms. While our framework is general for infinite\ndimensional manifolds, we specifically treat the case of diffeomorphisms,\nmotivated by optical flow problems in computer vision. This is accomplished by\nbuilding on a recent variational approach to a general class of accelerated\noptimization methods by Wibisono, Wilson and Jordan, which applies in finite\ndimensions. We generalize that approach to infinite dimensional manifolds. We\nderive the surprisingly simple continuum evolution equations, which are partial\ndifferential equations, for accelerated gradient descent, and relate it to\nsimple mechanical principles from fluid mechanics. Our approach has natural\nconnections to the optimal mass transport problem. This is because one can\nthink of our approach as an evolution of an infinite number of particles\nendowed with mass (represented with a mass density) that moves in an energy\nlandscape. The mass evolves with the optimization variable, and endows the\nparticles with dynamics. This is different than the finite dimensional case\nwhere only a single particle moves and hence the dynamics does not depend on\nthe mass.

These methods are effective to\nsome extent, but a number of challenges remain. First, HSIs and MSIs are\nnaturally third-order tensors (data \"cubes\") and thus matricization is prone to\nloss of structural information--which could degrade performance. Second, it is\nunclear whether or not these low-rank matrix-based fusion strategies can\nguarantee identifiability or exact recovery of the SRI. However,\nidentifiability plays a pivotal role in estimation problems and usually has a\nsignificant impact on performance in practice. Third, the majority of the\nexisting methods assume that there are known (or easily estimated) degradation\noperators applied to the SRI to form the corresponding HSI and MSI--which is\nhardly the case in practice.

The measured scaling relation of $N_r\nh^{1.71}$ is slightly smaller than the expected $N_r h^2$ scaling, presumably\nbecause the ribs cannot be regarded as completely isolated but interact.

{"prompt": "  An ideal memristor is defined as a resistor with memory that, when subject to\na time-dependent current, $I(t)$, its resistance $R_M(q)$ depends {\\it only} on\nthe charge $q$ that has flowed through it, so that its voltage response is\n$V(t)=R_M(q)I(t)$. It has been argued that a clear fingerprint of these ideal\nmemristors is a pinched hysteresis loop in their I-V curves. However, a pinched\nI-V hysteresis loop is not a definitive test of whether a resistor with memory\nis truly an ideal memristor because such a property is shared also by other\nresistors whose memory depends on additional internal state variables, other\nthan the charge. Here, we introduce a very simple and {\\it unambiguous} test\nthat can be utilized to check experimentally if a resistor with memory is\nindeed an ideal memristor. Our test is based on the duality property of a\ncapacitor-memristor circuit whereby, for any initial resistance states of the\nmemristor and any form of the applied voltage, the final state of an ideal\nmemristor must be identical to its initial state, if the capacitor charge\nfinally returns to its initial value. In actual experiments, a sufficiently\nwide range of voltage amplitudes and initial states are enough to perform the\ntest. The proposed test can help resolve some long-standing controversies still\nexisting in the literature about whether an ideal memristor does actually exist\nor it is a purely mathematical concept.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2018"}

{"prompt": "  The paper presents a review of dynamic stabilization mechanisms for plasma\ninstabilities. One of the dynamic stabilization mechanisms for plasma\ninstability was proposed in the papers [Phys. Plasmas 19, 024503(2012) and\nreferences therein], based on a perturbation phase control. In general,\ninstabilities emerge from the perturbations of the physical quantity. Normally\nthe perturbation phase is unknown so that the instability growth rate is\ndiscussed. However, if the perturbation phase is known, the instability growth\ncan be controlled by a superimposition of perturbations imposed actively: if\nthe perturbation is introduced by, for example, a driving beam axis oscillation\nor so, the perturbation phase can be controlled and the instability growth is\nmitigated by the superimposition of the growing perturbations. Based on this\nmechanism we present the application results of the dynamic stabilization\nmechanism to the Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) instability and to the filamentation\ninstability as typical examples in this paper. On the other hand, in the paper\n[Comments Plasma Phys. Controlled Fusion 3, 1(1977)] another mechanism was\nproposed to stabilize the R-T instability based on the strong oscillation of\nacceleration, which was realized by the laser intensity modulation in laser\ninertial fusion [Phys. Rev. Lett. 71, 3131(1993)]. In the latter mechanism, the\ntotal acceleration strongly oscillates, so that the additional oscillating\nforce is added to create a new stable window in the system. Originally the\nlatter mechanism was proposed by P. L. Kapitza, and it was applied to the\nstabilization of an inverted pendulum. In this paper we review the two dynamic\nstabilization mechanisms, and present the application results of the former\ndynamic stabilization mechanism.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2018"}

We find that 69% of the observed stars have [Fe/H] <= -1.0, 39%\nhave [Fe/H] <= -2.0, and 2% have [Fe/H] <= -3.0. There are also 133\ncarbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in this sample, with 97 CEMP Group I\nand 36 CEMP Group II stars identified in the A(C) versus [Fe/H] diagram.

{"prompt": "  We study the Casimir energy of bulk fields in AdS$_3$ and its relation to\nsubleading terms in the central charge of the dual CFT$_2$. Computing both\nsides of the standard CFT$_2$ relation $E=-c/12$ independently we show that\nthis relation is not necessarily satisfied at the level of individual bulk\nsupergravity states, but in theories with sufficient supersymmetry it is\nrestored at the level of bulk supermultiplets. Assuming only $(0,2)$\nsupersymmetry (or more), we improve the situation by relating quantum\ncorrections to the central charge and the supersymmetric Casimir energy which\nin turn is related to an index. These relations adapt recent progress on the\nAdS$_5$/CFT$_4$ correspondence to AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ holography. We test our\nformula successfully in several examples, including the $(0,4)$ MSW theory\ndescribing classes of 4D black holes and the large $(4,4)$ theory that is\ninteresting for higher spin holography.

{"prompt": "  This paper addresses the problem of recovering projective camera matrices\nfrom collections of fundamental matrices in multiview settings. We make two\nmain contributions. First, given ${n \\choose 2}$ fundamental matrices computed\nfor $n$ images, we provide a complete algebraic characterization in the form of\nconditions that are both necessary and sufficient to enabling the recovery of\ncamera matrices. These conditions are based on arranging the fundamental\nmatrices as blocks in a single matrix, called the $n$-view fundamental matrix,\nand characterizing this matrix in terms of the signs of its eigenvalues and\nrank structures. Secondly, we propose a concrete algorithm for projective\nstructure-from-motion that utilizes this characterization. Given a complete or\npartial collection of measured fundamental matrices, our method seeks camera\nmatrices that minimize a global algebraic error for the measured fundamental\nmatrices. In contrast to existing methods, our optimization, without any\ninitialization, produces a consistent set of fundamental matrices that\ncorresponds to a unique set of cameras (up to a choice of projective frame).\nOur experiments indicate that our method achieves state of the art performance\nin both accuracy and running time.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2018"}

{"prompt": "  In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end model, namely Single-Stage\nGrounding network (SSG), to localize the referent given a referring expression\nwithin an image. Different from previous multi-stage models which rely on\nobject proposals or detected regions, our proposed model aims to comprehend a\nreferring expression through one single stage without resorting to region\nproposals as well as the subsequent region-wise feature extraction.\nSpecifically, a multimodal interactor is proposed to summarize the local region\nfeatures regarding the referring expression attentively. Subsequently, a\ngrounder is proposed to localize the referring expression within the given\nimage directly. For further improving the localization accuracy, a guided\nattention mechanism is proposed to enforce the grounder to focus on the central\nregion of the referent. Moreover, by exploiting and predicting visual attribute\ninformation, the grounder can further distinguish the referent objects within\nan image and thereby improve the model performance. Experiments on RefCOCO,\nRefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg datasets demonstrate that our proposed SSG without\nrelying on any region proposals can achieve comparable performance with other\nadvanced models. Furthermore, our SSG outperforms the previous models and\nachieves the state-of-art performance on the ReferItGame dataset. More\nimportantly, our SSG is time efficient and can ground a referring expression in\na 416*416 image from the RefCOCO dataset in 25ms (40 referents per second) on\naverage with a Nvidia Tesla P40, accomplishing more than 9* speedups over the\nexisting multi-stage models.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2018"}
{"prompt": "  Partial differential equations (PDEs) are commonly derived based on empirical\nobservations. However, recent advances of technology enable us to collect and\nstore massive amount of data, which offers new opportunities for data-driven\ndiscovery of PDEs. In this paper, we propose a new deep neural network, called\nPDE-Net 2.0, to discover (time-dependent) PDEs from observed dynamic data with\nminor prior knowledge on the underlying mechanism that drives the dynamics. The\ndesign of PDE-Net 2.0 is based on our earlier work \\cite{Long2018PDE} where the\noriginal version of PDE-Net was proposed. PDE-Net 2.0 is a combination of\nnumerical approximation of differential operators by convolutions and a\nsymbolic multi-layer neural network for model recovery. Comparing with existing\napproaches, PDE-Net 2.0 has the most flexibility and expressive power by\nlearning both differential operators and the nonlinear response function of the\nunderlying PDE model. Numerical experiments show that the PDE-Net 2.0 has the\npotential to uncover the hidden PDE of the observed dynamics, and predict the\ndynamical behavior for a relatively long time, even in a noisy environment.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2018"}

{"prompt": "  The next generation of solar neutrino detectors will provide a precision\nmeasure of the $^8$B electron-neutrino spectrum in the energy range from 1-15\nMeV. Although the neutrino spectrum emitted by $^8$B $\\beta$-decay reactions in\nthe Sun's core is identical to the neutrino spectrum measured in the\nlaboratory, due to vacuum and matter flavor oscillations, this spectrum will be\nvery different from that measured on Earth by the different solar neutrino\nexperiments. We study how the presence of dark matter (DM) in the Sun's core\nchanges the shape of the $^8$B electron-neutrino spectrum. These modifications\nare caused by local variations of the electronic density and the $^8$B neutrino\nsource, induced by local changes of the temperature, density and chemical\ncomposition. Particularly relevant are the shape changes at low and medium\nenergy range $(E_\\nu\\le 10 {\\; \\rm MeV})$, for which the experimental noise\nlevel is expected to be quite small. If such a distortion in the $^8$B$\\nu_e$\nspectrum were to be observed, this would strongly hint in favor of the\nexistence of DM in the Sun's core. The $^8$B electron-neutrino spectrum\nprovides a complementary method to helioseismology and total neutrino fluxes\nfor constraining the DM properties. In particular, we study the impact of light\nasymmetric DM on solar neutrino spectra. Accurate neutrino spectra measurements\ncould help to determine whether light asymmetric DM exists in the Sun's core,\nsince it has been recently advocated that this type of DM might resolve the\nsolar abundance problem.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2018"}
