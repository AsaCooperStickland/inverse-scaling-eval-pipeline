The York time ${}^3K$ (the relativistic\ninertial gauge variable, not existing in Newtonian gravity, parametrizing the\nfamily and connected to the freedom in clock synchronization, i.e. to the\ndefinition of the instantaneous 3-spaces) is put equal to an arbitrary\nnumerical function. A ultraviolet cutoff on the matter allows a consistent\nlinearization, which is shown to be the lowest order of a Hamiltonian\nPost-Minkowskian (HPM) expansion. We solve the constraints and the Hamilton\nequations for the tidal variables and we find Post-Minkowskian gravitational\nwaves with asymptotic background (and the correct quadrupole emission formula\nand energy balance) propagating on dynamically determined non-Euclidean\n3-spaces in these non-harmonic gauges.

The cluster formation was\nmonitored using different formulation pathways, including direct mixing,\ndialysis, dilution and quenching.

This wave acts like a highly\ncorrelated local \"boson\" satisfying a modified Cooper problem with additional\ncorrelation stabilization relative to the separate right- and left-handed\ndensity waves composing it. This local \"boson\" could be formed in a two-bound\nroton-like manner; it has Fermion statistics. Delocalized superconductive\npairing (superconductivity) is achieved by a Feshbach resonance of two unpaired\nholes (electrons) resonating with a virtual energy level of the bound pair\nstate of the local \"boson\" as described by the Boson-Fermion-Gossamer (BFG)\nmodel. The spin-charge order interaction offers an explanation for the overall\nshape of the superconducting dome as well a microscopic basis for the cuprate\nsuperconducting transition temperatures.

We employ stochastic\ndifferential equations and probability distributions obtained from stochastic\nsimulations to characterize differential signaling response in our minimal\nnetwork model. We show that the proposed minimal signaling network displays two\ndistinct types of response as the strength of the stimulus is decreased. The\nsignaling network has a deterministic part that undergoes rapid activation by a\nstrong stimulus in which case cell-to-cell fluctuations can be ignored. As the\nstrength of the stimulus decreases, the stochastic part of the network begins\ndominating the signaling response where slow activation is observed with\ncharacteristic large cell-to-cell stochastic variability. Interestingly, this\nproposed stochastic signaling network can capture some of the essential\nsignaling behaviors of a complex apoptotic cell death signaling network that\nhas been studied through experiments and large-scale computer simulations. Thus\nwe claim that the proposed signaling network is an appropriate minimal model of\napoptosis signaling.

{"prompt": "  In recent years genetic algorithms have emerged as a useful tool for the\nheuristic solution of complex discrete optimisation problems. In particular\nthere has been considerable interest in their use in tackling problems arising\nin the areas of scheduling and timetabling. However, the classical genetic\nalgorithm paradigm is not well equipped to handle constraints and successful\nimplementations usually require some sort of modification to enable the search\nto exploit problem specific knowledge in order to overcome this shortcoming.\nThis paper is concerned with the development of a family of genetic algorithms\nfor the solution of a nurse rostering problem at a major UK hospital. The\nhospital is made up of wards of up to 30 nurses. Each ward has its own group of\nnurses whose shifts have to be scheduled on a weekly basis. In addition to\nfulfilling the minimum demand for staff over three daily shifts, nurses' wishes\nand qualifications have to be taken into account. The schedules must also be\nseen to be fair, in that unpopular shifts have to be spread evenly amongst all\nnurses, and other restrictions, such as team nursing and special conditions for\nsenior staff, have to be satisfied. The basis of the family of genetic\nalgorithms is a classical genetic algorithm consisting of n-point crossover,\nsingle-bit mutation and a rank-based selection. The solution space consists of\nall schedules in which each nurse works the required number of shifts, but the\nremaining constraints, both hard and soft, are relaxed and penalised in the\nfitness function. The talk will start with a detailed description of the\nproblem and the initial implementation and will go on to highlight the\nshortcomings of such an approach, in terms of the key element of balancing\nfeasibility, i.e. covering the demand and work regulations, and quality, as\nmeasured by the nurses' preferences. A series of experiments involving\nparameter adaptation, niching, intelligent weights, delta coding, local hill\nclimbing, migration and special selection rules will then be outlined and it\nwill be shown how a series of these enhancements were able to eradicate these\ndifficulties. Results based on several months' real data will be used to\nmeasure the impact of each modification, and to show that the final algorithm\nis able to compete with a tabu search approach currently employed at the\nhospital. The talk will conclude with some observations as to the overall\nquality of this approach to this and similar problems.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 10\n"}

Non-local ones are\nlocalized along soliton trajectories.\n  Examples are presented of how, with the aid of local special polynomials, one\ncan modify equations that have only a single-soliton solution into ones, which\nhave that solution as well as, at least, a two-solitons solutions.\n  Given an integrable equation, with the aid of local special polynomials, it\nis possible to find all evolution equations in higher scaling weights, which\nshare the same single-soliton solution and are either integrable, or, at least,\nhave a two-solitons solution. This is demonstrated for one or two consecutive\nscaling weights for a number of known equations.\n  In the study of perturbed integrable equations, local special polynomials are\nresponsible for inelastic soliton interactions generated by the perturbation in\nthe multiple-soliton case, and for the (possible) loss of asymptotic\nintegrability. Non-local special polynomials describe higher-order corrections\nto the solution, which are of an inelastic nature.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 10\n"}

In this work we bring out the\npossibilities of passing from the former to the latter, via action of\nclassicality preserving systems like beamsplitters, in a transparent manner.\nFor single mode states, a complete description of nonclassicality is available\nvia the classical theory of moments, as a set of necessary and sufficient\nconditions on the photon number distribution. We show that when the mode is\ncoupled to an ancilla in any coherent state, and the system is then acted upon\nby a beamsplitter, these conditions turn exactly into signatures of NPT\nentanglement of the output state. Since the classical moment problem does not\ngeneralize to two or more modes, we turn in these cases to other familiar\nsufficient but not necessary conditions for nonclassicality, namely the Mandel\nparameter criterion and its extensions. We generalize the Mandel matrix from\none-mode states to the two-mode situation, leading to a natural classification\nof states with varying levels of nonclassicality. For two--mode states we\npresent a single test that can, if successful, simultaneously show\nnonclassicality as well as NPT entanglement.

In bioinformatics, psychometrics and data mining,\nhierarchical clustering techniques output the same mathematical objects, and\npractitioners have similar questions about the stability and `generalizability'\nof these summaries. This paper provides an implementation of the geometric\ndistance between trees developed by Billera, Holmes and Vogtmann (2001) [BHV]\nequally applicable to phylogenetic trees and hieirarchical clustering trees,\nand shows some of the applications in statistical inference for which this\ndistance can be useful. In particular, since BHV have shown that the space of\ntrees is negatively curved (a CAT(0) space), a natural representation of a\ncollection of trees is a tree. We compare this representation to the Euclidean\napproximations of treespace made available through Multidimensional Scaling of\nthe matrix of distances between trees.

Using detailed near-infrared imaging and\nthe circular velocities of axisymmetric Jeans models of 14 nearby edge-on Sa-Sb\nspirals and 14 nearby edge-on S0s drawn from a range of environments, we find\nthat S0s lie on a TFR with the same slope as the spirals, but are on average\n0.53+/-0.15 mag fainter at Ks-band at a given rotational velocity. This is a\nsignificantly smaller offset than that measured in earlier studies of the S0\nTFR, which we attribute to our elimination of the bias associated with using\ndifferent rotation measures and our use of earlier type spirals as a reference.\nSince our measurement of the offset avoids systematic biases, it should be\npreferred to previous estimates. A spiral stellar population in which star\nformation is truncated would take ~1 Gyr to fade by 0.53 mag at Ks-band. If S0s\nare the products of a simple truncation of star formation in spirals, then this\nfinding is difficult to reconcile with the observed evolution of the spiral/S0\nfraction with redshift. Recent star formation could explain the observed lack\nof fading in S0s, but the offset of the S0 TFR persists as a function of both\nstellar and dynamical mass.

We\nassociate the optical outbursts with propagation of the superluminal knots and\nderive the location of sites of energy dissipation in the form of radiation.\nThe most prominent and long-lasting of these, in 2005 May, occurred closer to\nthe black hole, while the outbursts with a shorter duration in 2005 Autumn and\nin 2007 might be connected with the passage of a disturbance through the\nmillimeter-wave core of the jet.

We combine these data with\npreviously published near-infrared spectroscopy and mid-infrared photometry, to\nproduce the spectral energy distribution for the very low-temperature T dwarf.\nWe use atmospheric models to derive the bolometric correction and obtain a\nluminosity of log L/Lsun = -6.01 +/- 0.05.

We further restrict\nthe allowed range of T_eff and gravity using age constraints implied by the M\ndwarf primary, and refine the physical properties of the T dwarf by comparison\nof the observed and modelled spectroscopy and photometry. This comparison\nindicates that Wolf 940 B has a metallicity within 0.2 dex of solar, as more\nextreme values give poor fits to the data - lower metallicity produces a poor\nfit at lambda > 2um while higher metallicity produces a poor fit at lambda <\n2um.

{"prompt": "  Stimulated emission of photons from a large number of atoms into the mode of\na strong light field is the principle mechanism for lasing in \"classical\"\nlasers. The onset of lasing is marked by a threshold which can be characterised\nby a sharp increase in photon flux as a function of external pumping strength.\nThe same is not necessarily true for the fundamental building block of a laser:\na single trapped atom interacting with a single optical radiation mode. It has\nbeen shown that such a \"quantum\" laser can exhibit thresholdless lasing in the\nregime of strong coupling between atom and radiation field. However, although\ntheoretically predicted, a threshold at the single-atom level could not be\nexperimentally observed so far. Here, we demonstrate and characterise a\nsingle-atom laser with and without threshold behaviour by changing the strength\nof atom-light field coupling. We observe the establishment of a laser threshold\nthrough the accumulation of photons in the optical mode even for a mean photon\nnumber substantially lower than for the classical case. Furthermore,\nself-quenching occurs for very strong external pumping and constitutes an\nintrinsic limitation of single-atom lasers. Moreover, we find that the\nstatistical properties of the emitted light can be adjusted for weak external\npumping, from the quantum to the classical domain.

To do this requires an understanding of the\npotential effects of differential CO excitation with SFR. If the most heavily\nstar-forming galaxies have a larger fraction of their gas in highly excited CO\nstates than the lower SFR galaxies, then the observed molecular SFR-CO^alpha\nindex, alpha, will be less than the underlying (volumetric) Schmidt index, N.\nUtilising a combination of SPH models of galaxy evolution and molecular line\nradiative transfer, we present the first calculations of CO excitation in z~2\ndisc galaxies with the aim of developing a mapping between various observed\nSFR-CO relationships and the underlying Schmidt relation. We find that even in\nrelatively luminous z~2 discs, differential excitation does indeed exist,\nresulting in alpha < N for highly excited CO lines.

Although CEMP stars have been\nfound previously among candidate metal-poor stars selected from the HES, the\nselection on metallicity undersamples the population of\nintermediate-metallicity CEMP stars (-2.5<=[Fe/H]<=-1.0); such stars are of\nimportance for constraining the onset of the s-process in metal-deficient\nasymptotic giant-branch stars (thought to be associated with the origin of\ncarbon for roughly 80% of CEMP stars). The new candidates also include\nsubstantial numbers of warmer carbon-enhanced stars, which were missed in\nprevious HES searches for carbon stars due to selection criteria that\nemphasized stars with cooler temperatures.\n  A first subsample, biased towards brighter stars (B<15.5), has been extracted\nfrom the scanned HES plates.

{"prompt": "  The characterization of the wind speed vertical distribution V(h) is\nfundamental for an astronomical site for many different reasons: (1) the wind\nspeed shear contributes to trigger optical turbulence in the whole troposphere,\n(2) a few of the astroclimatic parameters such as the wavefront coherence time\n(tau_0) depends directly on V(h), (3) the equivalent velocity V_0, controlling\nthe frequency at which the adaptive optics systems have to run to work\nproperly, depends on the vertical distribution of the wind speed and optical\nturbulence. Also, a too strong wind speed near the ground can introduce\nvibrations in the telescope structures. The wind speed at a precise pressure\n(200 hPa) has frequently been used to retrieve indications concerning the tau_0\nand the frequency limits imposed to all instrumentation based on adaptive\noptics systems, but more recently it has been proved that V_200 (wind speed at\n200 hPa) alone is not sufficient to provide exhaustive elements concerning this\ntopic and that the vertical distribution of the wind speed is necessary.

Here we examine the prospects\nfor further constraining the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model\n(CMSSM) with future ton-scale direct detection experiments. We consider\nton-scale extrapolations of three current experiments: CDMS, XENON and COUPP,\nwith 1000 kg-years of raw exposure each.

We introduce the idea of\nPure Type Sequent Calculus with meta-variables (PTSCalpha), by enriching the\nsyntax of a permutation-free sequent calculus for propositional logic due to\nHerbelin, which is strongly related to natural deduction and already well\nadapted to proof-search. The operational semantics is adapted from Herbelin's\nand is defined by a system of local rewrite rules as in cut-elimination, using\nexplicit substitutions. We prove confluence for this system. Restricting our\nattention to PTSC, a type system for the ground terms of this system, we obtain\nthe Subject Reduction property and show that each PTSC is logically equivalent\nto its corresponding PTS, and the former is strongly normalising iff the latter\nis. We show how to make the logical rules of PTSC into a syntax-directed system\nPS for proof-search, by incorporating the conversion rules as in\nsyntax-directed presentations of the PTS rules for type-checking.

We\nplot the new phase diagram which can be used, together with the information\nabout the anomalous dimension, to propose ideal models of walking technicolor.\nWe discover that when the extended technicolor sector, responsible for giving\nmasses to the standard model fermions, is sufficiently strongly coupled the\ntechnicolor theory, in isolation, must have an infrared fixed point for the\nfull model to be phenomenologically viable. Using the new phase diagram we show\nthat the simplest one family and minimal walking technicolor models are the\narchetypes of models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking.

The theory most consistent with observational\nconstraints, especially thermal histories, is the so-called \"shock model\", in\nwhich chondrules were melted in solar nebula shocks. However, several problems\nhave been identified with previous shock models. These problems all pertained\nto the treatment of the radiation field, namely the input boundary condition to\nthe radiation field, the proper treatment of the opacity of solids, and the\nproper treatment of molecular line cooling. In this paper, we present the\nresults of our updated shock model, which corrects for the problems listed\nabove. Our new hydrodynamic shock code includes a complete treatment of\nmolecular line cooling due to H2O. Previously, shock models including line\ncooling predicted chondrule cooling rates exceeding 100,000 K/hr. Contrary to\nthese expectations, we have found that the effect of line cooling is minimal;\nafter the inclusion of line cooling, the cooling rates of chondrules are\n10-1000 K/hr. The reduction in the otherwise rapid cooling rates attributable\nto line cooling is due to a combination of factors, including buffering due to\nhydrogen recombination/dissociation, high column densities of water, and\nbackwarming.

By adopting the semiclassical\nmethod, the modification of the propagation of an emitted particle is examined.\nIn analogy to the optical model applied to nuclear reactions, our\nphenomenological model has an imaginary part of the potential, which describes\nthe absorption in the cloud. In this work, we focus on the pion interferometry\nand mean field interaction obtained using a phenomenological $\\pi\\pi$ forward\nscattering amplitude in the elastic channels. The p-wave scattering with $\\rho$\nmeson resonance leads to an attractive mean field interaction, and the presence\nof the absorptive part is mainly attributed to the formation of this resonance.\nWe also incorporate a simple time dependence of the potential reflecting the\ndynamics of the evaporating source. Using the obtained potential, we examine\nhow and to what extent the so-called HBT Gaussian radius is varied by the\nmodification of the propagation.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 10\n"}

It is found that the imaginary part of the local\nrefractive index Im n(u;w) may be negative as well as positive, corresponding\nto a local amplification as well as attenuation of the amplitude of the\nrenormalized photon field. This is interpreted in terms of the effect of tidal\nforces on the virtual e^+e^- cloud surrounding the bare photon field---a\npositive/negative Im n(u;w) corresponds to an increased dressing/undressing of\nthe bare photon. Below threshold decays of the photon to e^+e^- pairs can\noccur. Photon undressing in the vicinity of a black hole singularity is\ndescribed as an example.

{"prompt": "  GD 356 is unique among magnetic white dwarfs because it shows Zeeman-split\nBalmer lines in pure emission.

The energy\nsource that heats the photosphere remains a mystery but it is likely to be\nassociated with the presence of a companion. Based on current models we use\narchival Spitzer IRAC observations to place a new and stringent upper limit of\n12 Jupiter masses for the mass of such a companion. In the light of this result\nand the recent discovery of a 115 min photometric period for GD 356, we exclude\nprevious models that invoke accretion and revisit the unipolar inductor model\nthat has been proposed for this system. In this model a highly conducting\nplanet with a metallic core orbits the magnetic white dwarf and, as it cuts\nthrough field lines, a current is set flowing between the two bodies. This\ncurrent dissipates in the photosphere of the white dwarf and causes a\ntemperature inversion. Such a planet is unlikely to have survived the RGB/AGB\nphases of evolution so we argue that it may have formed from the circumstellar\ndisc of a disrupted He or CO core during a rare merger of two white dwarfs.

We quantify the statistics of the\nmagnetic-field fluctuations by deriving rotation measure structure functions,\nwhich we fit using models derived from theoretical power spectra.

{"prompt": "  In this paper, we study the optimal secondary-link beamforming pattern that\nbalances between the SU's throughput and the interference it causes to PUs in\nMIMO cognitive radio networks. In particular, we aim to maximize the throughput\nof the SU, while keeping the interference temperature at the primary receivers\nbelow a certain threshold.\n  Unlike traditional MIMO systems, SUs may not have the luxury of knowing the\nchannel state information (CSI) on the links to PUs. This presents a key\nchallenge for a secondary transmitter to steer interference away from primary\nreceivers. In this paper, we consider three scenarios, namely when the\nsecondary transmitter has complete, partial, or no knowledge about the channels\nto the primary receivers. In particular, when complete CSI is not available,\nthe interference-temperature constraints are to be satisfied with high\nprobability, thus resulting in chance constraints that are typically hard to\ndeal with. Our contribution is fourfold. First, by analyzing the distributional\ncharacteristics of MIMO channels, we propose a unified homogeneous QCQP\nformulation that can be applied to all three scenarios. The homogeneous QCQP\nformulation, though non-convex, is amenable to semidefinite programming (SDP)\nrelaxation methods. Secondly, we show that the SDP relaxation admits no gap\nwhen the number of primary links is no larger than two. Thirdly, we propose a\nrandomized polynomial-time algorithm for constructing a near-optimal solution\nto the QCQP problem when there are more than two primary links. Finally, we\nshow that when the secondary transmitter has no CSI on the links to primary\nreceivers, the optimal solution to the QCQP problem can be found by a simple\nmatrix eigenvalue-eigenvector computation, which can be done much more\nefficiently than solving the QCQP directly.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 10\n"}

In this paper, we emphasise this issue and propose a\nnovel Self-Taught Hashing (STH) approach to semantic hashing: we first find the\noptimal $l$-bit binary codes for all documents in the given corpus via\nunsupervised learning, and then train $l$ classifiers via supervised learning\nto predict the $l$-bit code for any query document unseen before. Our\nexperiments on three real-world text datasets show that the proposed approach\nusing binarised Laplacian Eigenmap (LapEig) and linear Support Vector Machine\n(SVM) outperforms state-of-the-art techniques significantly.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 10\n"}

We report here on a 42ks XMM observation of the first\nobject of the sample, the cluster Abell 2028. The XMM observation reveals a\ncomplex structure of the cluster over scale of 300 kpc, showing an interaction\nbetween two sub-clusters in cometary-like configurations. At the leading edges\nof the two substructures cold fronts have been detected. The core of the main\nsubcluster is likely hosting a cool corona. We show that a one-component fit\nfor this region returns a biased high metallicity. This inverse iron bias is\ndue to the behavior of the fitting code in shaping the Fe-L complex. In\npresence of a multi-temperature structure of the ICM, the best-fit metallicity\nis artificially higher when the projected spectrum is modeled with a single\ntemperature component and it is not related to the presence of both Fe-L and\nFe-K emission lines in the spectrum. After accounting for the bias, the overall\nabundance of the cluster is consistent with the one typical of hotter, more\nmassive clusters. We caution the interpretation of high abundances inferred\nwhen fitting a single thermal component to spectra derived from relatively\nlarge apertures in 3-4 keV clusters, because the inverse iron bias can be\npresent.

Due to the interplay of surface\ntension, gravity force and light-metal interaction, undulating pendant droplets\nare formed at the molten end, which eventually completely detach from the wire\nas a consequence of their increasing mass. We capture the dynamics of this\nprocess by employing a high-speed infrared camera, thereby indirectly measuring\nthe temperature of the wire end and the pendant droplets. The time series is\nsubsequently generated as the mean value over the pixel intensity of every\ninfrared snapshot. Finally, we employ methods of nonlinear time series analysis\nto reconstruct the phase space from the observed variable and test it against\ndeterminism and stationarity. After establishing that the observed laser\ndroplet generation is a deterministic and dynamically stationary process, we\ncalculate the spectra of Lyapunov exponents.

Here we follow original works of Ne'eman and Fairlie believing that\nbosonic fields take their values in the Lie superalgebra and fermionic fields\ntake their values in its representation space.

Combining them and the spectra of\nthe B stars from our previous investigations ($\\sim$430 cluster and $\\sim$100\nfield B stars) yields a large, homogeneous sample for studying the rotational\nproperties of B stars. We derive the projected rotational velocity $V\\sin i$,\neffective temperature, gravity, mass, and critical rotation speed $V_{\\rm\ncrit}$ for each star. We find that the average $V\\sin i$ is significantly lower\namong field stars because they are systematically more evolved and spun down\nthan their cluster counterparts. The rotational distribution functions of\n$V_{\\rm eq}/V_{\\rm crit}$ for the least evolved B stars show that lower mass B\nstars are born with a larger proportion of rapid rotators than higher mass B\nstars. However, the upper limit of $V_{\\rm eq}/V_{\\rm crit}$ that may separate\nnormal B stars from emission line Be stars (where rotation promotes mass loss\ninto a circumstellar disk) is smaller among the higher mass B stars. We compare\nthe evolutionary trends of rotation (measured according to the polar gravity of\nthe star) with recent models that treat internal mixing. The spin-down rates\nobserved in the high mass subset ($\\sim 9 M_\\odot$) agree with predictions, but\nthe rates are larger for the low mass group ($\\sim 3 M_\\odot$). The faster spin\ndown in the low mass B stars matches well with the predictions based on\nconservation of angular momentum in individual spherical shells.

For hundreds of years this\nscience has relied upon no-slip boundary conditions at the solid-liquid\ninterface that has been applied successfully to model many macroscopic\nexperiments, and the state of this interface has played a minor role in\ndetermining the flow. However, the problem is not that simple and has been\nrevisited recently. Due to the change in the properties of the interface, such\nas wettability and roughness, this classical boundary condition could be\nviolated, leading to a hydrodynamic slip. In this chapter, we review recent\nadvances in the understanding and expectations for the hydrodynamic boundary\nconditions in different situations, by focussing mostly on key papers from past\ndecade.

The structure function analysis indicate most of the power\nspectral density is detected on hourly time scales in all wavelength bands. We\nalso report minute time scale variability at 7 and 13mm placing a strong\nconstraint on the nature of the variable emission. The hourly time scale\nvariability can be explained in the context of a model in which the peak\nfrequency of emission shifts toward lower frequencies as a self-absorbed\nsynchrotron source expands adiabatically near the acceleration site. The short\ntime scale variability, on the other hand, places a strong constraint on the\nsize of the emitting region.

We are interested in their propagation in interstellar medium (ISM)\nafter they leave the shock neighborhood where they are accelerated, but when\nthey are still near the SNR with their energy density higher than that in the\naverage ISM. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, we found that the cosmic-rays with\nenergies of <~TeV excite Alfven waves around the SNR on a scale of the SNR\nitself if the ISM is highly ionized. Thus, even if the cosmic-rays can leave\nthe shock, scattering by the waves prevents them from moving further away from\nthe SNR.

Thus\nproper quantization of the source-free Maxwell equations is identical to second\nquantization of free photons that have normal square-root energy. There is no\nphysical reason why first and second quantization of any relativistic free\nparticle ought not to proceed in precise parallel, utilizing the square-root\nHamiltonian operator. This natural procedure leaves no role for the completely\nartificial Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations, as accords with their grossly\nunphysical properties.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 10\n"}

{"prompt": "  Understanding under what conditions interacting populations, whether they be\nplants, animals, or viral particles, coexist is a question of theoretical and\npractical importance in population biology. Both biotic interactions and\nenvironmental fluctuations are key factors that can facilitate or disrupt\ncoexistence. To better understand this interplay between these deterministic\nand stochastic forces, we develop a mathematical theory extending the nonlinear\ntheory of permanence for deterministic systems to stochastic difference and\ndifferential equations. Our condition for coexistence requires that there is a\nfixed set of weights associated with the interacting populations and this\nweighted combination of populations' invasion rates is positive for any\n(ergodic) stationary distribution associated with a subcollection of\npopulations. Here, an invasion rate corresponds to an average per-capita growth\nrate along a stationary distribution. When this condition holds and there is\nsufficient noise in the system, we show that the populations approach a unique\npositive stationary distribution. Moreover, we show that our coexistence\ncriterion is robust to small perturbations of the model functions. Using this\ntheory, we illustrate that (i) environmental noise enhances or inhibits\ncoexistence in communities with rock-paper-scissor dynamics depending on\ncorrelations between interspecific demographic rates, (ii) stochastic variation\nin mortality rates has no effect on the coexistence criteria for discrete-time\nLotka-Volterra communities, and (iii) random forcing can promote genetic\ndiversity in the presence of exploitative interactions.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 10\n"}

The brightest emission\ncomes from HI Ly-alpha and the strongest metal line, CIII, is about an order of\nmagnitude fainter, although HI Ly-alpha may be fainter if the gas is\nself-shielded to the UV background or if dust is important. The highest surface\nbrightness regions for CIV, SiIII, SiIV and OVI are fainter than CIII by\nfactors of a few. The NV and NeVIII lines, as well as HeII H-alpha, are\nsubstantially weaker but their maximum surface brightnesses still exceed 100\nphoton/cm^2/s/sr at z=2 (for 2\" pixels). Lower ionisation lines arise in denser\nand colder gas that produces clumpier emission. The brightest HI Ly-alpha\nemission arises in highly overdense gas, but the highest surface brightness\nemission from high-ionisation metal lines traces a wider range of\noverdensities.

{"prompt": "  The nano-scale intrinsic Josephson junctions in highly anisotropic cuprate\nsuperconductors have potential for generation of terahertz electromagnetic\nwaves. When the thickness of a superconductor sample is much smaller than the\nwavelength of electromagnetic waves in vacuum, the superconductor renders\nitself as a cavity. Unlike conventional lasers, the presence of the cavity does\nnot guarantee a coherent emission because of the internal degree of freedom of\nthe superconductivity phase in long junctions. We study the excitation of\nterahertz wave by solitons in a stack of intrinsic Josephson junctions,\nespecially for relatively short junctions. Coherent emission requires a\nrectangular configuration of solitons. However such a configuration is unstable\nagainst weak fluctuations, contrarily solitons favor a triangular lattice\ncorresponding to an out phase oscillation of electromagnetic waves. To utilize\nthe cavity, we propose to use an array of stacks of short intrinsic Josephson\njunctions to generate powerful terahertz electromagnetic waves. The cavity\nsynchronizes the plasma oscillation in different stacks and the emission\nintensity is predicted to be proportional to the number of stacks squared.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 10\n"}
{"prompt": "  We present a new primary transit observation of the hot-jupiter HD189733b,\nobtained at 3.6 microns with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) onboard the\nSpitzer Space Telescope. Previous measurements at 3.6 microns suffered from\nstrong systematics and conclusions could hardly be obtained with confidence on\nthe water detection by comparison of the 3.6 and 5.8 microns observations. We\nuse a high S/N Spitzer photometric transit light curve to improve the precision\nof the near infrared radius of the planet at 3.6 microns. The observation has\nbeen performed using high-cadence time series integrated in the subarray mode.\nWe are able to derive accurate system parameters, including planet-to-star\nradius ratio, impact parameter, scale of the system, and central time of the\ntransit from the fits of the transit light curve. We compare the results with\ntransmission spectroscopic models and with results from previous observations\nat the same wavelength. We obtained the following system parameters:\nR_p/R_\\star=0.15566+0.00011-0.00024, b=0.661+0.0053-0.0050, and\na/R_\\star=8.925+0.0490-0.0523 at 3.6 microns. These measurements are three\ntimes more accurate than previous studies at this wavelength because they\nbenefit from greater observational efficiency and less statistic and systematic\nerrors. Nonetheless, we find that the radius ratio has to be corrected for\nstellar activity and present a method to do so using ground-based long-duration\nphotometric follow-up in the V-band. The resulting planet-to-star radius ratio\ncorrected for the stellar variability is in agreement with the previous\nmeasurement obtained in the same bandpass (Desert et al. 2009). We also discuss\nthat water vapour could not be evidenced by comparison of the planetary radius\nmeasured at 3.6 and 5.8 microns, because the radius measured at 3.6 microns is\naffected by absorption by other species, possibly Rayleigh scattering by haze.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 10\n"}

This component is located ~325 pc from the core, which is\nvariable and has a peaked radio spectrum. In the case of 3C318, a rest-frame RM\nof ~3030 rad/m**2 has been estimated for the brightest component which\ncontributes almost all of the polarised emission. Further, two more extended\ncomponents have been detected, clearly showing \"wiggles\" in the jet towards the\nsouthern side of the source. The CSS source 3C343 contains two peaks of\nemission and a curved jet embedded in more diffuse emission. It exhibits\ncomplex field directions near the emission peaks, which indicate rest-frame RM\nvalues in excess of ~6000 rad/m**2. The locations of the cores in 3C318 and\n3C343 are not clear. The available data on mas-scale rest-frame RM estimates\nfor CSS sources show that these have a wide range of values extending up to\n~40000 rad/m**2 in the central region of OQ172, and could be located at\nprojected distances from the core of up to ~1600 pc, as in 3C43 where this\nfeature has a rest-frame RM of ~14000 rad/m**2.

Here we\nreport on geometrical constraints which impede the formation of quasicrystals\nwith certain symmetries in a colloidal model system.

Unfortunately the large\nGunn-Peterson optical depth of the surrounding neutral intergalactic medium\n(IGM) is thought to render this line extremely difficult to detect prior to\nreionization. In this paper we demonstrate that the radiative transfer effects\nin the interstellar medium (ISM), which cause Lya flux to emerge from galaxies\nat frequencies where the Gunn-Peterson optical depth is reduced, can\nsubstantially enhance the prospects for detection of the Lya line at high\nredshift. In particular, scattering off outflows of interstellar HI gas can\nmodify the Lya spectral line shape such that >5% of the emitted Lya radiation\nis transmitted directly to the observer, even through a fully neutral IGM. It\nmay therefore be possible to directly observe `strong' Lya emission lines (EW >\n50 Angstrom rest frame) from the highest redshift galaxies that reside in the\nsmallest HII `bubbles' early in the reionization era with JWST. In addition, we\nshow that outflows can boost the fraction of Lya radiation that is transmitted\nthrough the IGM during the latter stages of reionization, and even\npost-reionization. Coupled with the fact that the first generation of galaxies\nare thought to have very large intrinsic equivalent Lya equivalent widths, our\nresults suggest that the search for galaxies in their redshifted Lya emission\nline can be competitive with the drop-out technique out to the highest\nredshifts that can be probed in the JWST era.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 10\n"}

The UV\ndata from both XMM-Newton and Swift seem to confirm a UV excess that is likely\ncaused by thermal emission from the accretion disc. The X-ray data from\nXMM-Newton indicate a strongly concave spectrum, as well as moderate flux\nvariability on an hour time scale. The Swift X-ray data reveal fast (interday)\nflux changes, not correlated with those observed at lower energies. We compare\nthe spectral energy distribution (SED) corresponding to the 2008 low-brightness\nstate, which was characterised by a synchrotron dominance, to the 1997 outburst\nstate, where the inverse-Compton emission was prevailing. A fit with an\ninhomogeneous helical jet model suggests that two synchrotron components are at\nwork with their self inverse-Compton emission. Most likely, they represent the\nradiation from two distinct emitting regions in the jet. We show that the\ndifference between the source SEDs in 2008 and 1997 can be explained in terms\nof pure geometrical variations. The outburst state occurred when the\njet-emitting regions were better aligned with the line of sight, producing an\nincrease of the Doppler beaming factor. Our analysis demonstrates that the jet\ngeometry can play an extremely important role in the BL Lacertae flux and\nspectral variability.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 10\n"}
{"prompt": "  All-oxide magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) incorporating functional materials\nas insulating barriers have the potential of becoming the founding technology\nfor novel multi-functional devices. We investigate, by first-principles density\nfunctional theory, the bias-dependent transport properties of an all-oxide\nSrRuO3/BaTiO3/SrRuO3 MTJ. This incorporates a BaTiO3 barrier which can be found\neither in a non-ferroic or in a ferroelectric state. In such an MTJ not only\ncan the tunneling magnetoresistance reach enormous values, but also, for\ncertain voltages, its sign can be changed by altering the barrier electric\nstate. These findings pave the way for a new generation of\nelectrically-controlled magnetic sensors.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 10\n"}
{"prompt": "  Scalar fields with a \"chameleon\" property, in which the effective particle\nmass is a function of its local environment, are common to many theories beyond\nthe standard model and could be responsible for dark energy. If these fields\ncouple weakly to the photon, they could be detectable through the \"afterglow\"\neffect of photon-chameleon-photon transitions. The ADMX experiment was used in\nthe first chameleon search with a microwave cavity to set a new limit on scalar\nchameleon-photon coupling excluding values between 2*10^9 and 5*10^14 for\neffective chameleon masses between 1.9510 and 1.9525 micro-eV.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 10\n"}
