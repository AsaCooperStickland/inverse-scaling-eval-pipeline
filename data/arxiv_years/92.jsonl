The classical equations of the theory are the complex\n$sl(n)$ affine Toda equations which admit soliton solutions with real masses.\nThe classical scattering theory of the solitons is developed using Hirota's\nsolution techniques. A form for the soliton $S$-matrix is proposed based on the\nconstraints of $S$-matrix theory, integrability and the requirement that the\nsemi-classical limit is consistent with the semi-classical WKB quantization of\nthe classical scattering theory. The proposed $S$-matrix is an intertwiner of\nthe quantum group associated to $sl(n)$, where the deformation parameter is a\nfunction of the coupling constant. It is further shown that the $S$-matrix\ndescribes a non-unitary theory, which reflects the fact that the classical\nHamiltonian is complex. The spectrum of the theory is found to consist of the\nbasic solitons, scalar states (or breathers) and excited (or `breathing')\nsolitons.

A\np-group E is called extraspecial iff Phi (E) = E' = Z(E) cong Z_p, the cyclic\ngroup with p elements.\n  When generalizing a characterization of centre-by-finite groups due to B. H.\nNeumann, M. J. Tomkinson asked the following question. Is there an FC-group G\nwith vert G / Z(G) vert = kappa but [G:N_G(U)] < kappa for all (abelian)\nsubgroups U of G, where kappa is an uncountable cardinal. We consider this\nquestion for kappa = omega_1 and kappa = omega_2. It turns out that the answer\nis largely independent of ZFC, and that it differs greatly in the two cases.\n  More explicitly, for kappa = omega_1, it is consistent with, and independent\nof, ZFC that there is a group G with vert G / Z(G) vert = omega_1 and [G:N_G\n(A)] leq omega for all abelian A leq G. We do not know whether the same\nstatement is still consistent if we drop abelian. On the other hand, for kappa\n= omega_2, the non-existence of groups G with vert G / Z(G) vert = omega_2 and\n[G : N_G (A) ] leq omega_1 for all (abelian) A leq G is equiconsistent with the\nexistence of an inaccessible cardinal. In particular, there is an extraspecial\np-group with this property if there is a Kurepa tree.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 92"}
{"prompt": "  It is proved that the projection constants of two- and three-dimensional\nspaces are bounded by $4/3$ and $(1+\\sqrt 5)/2$, respectively. These bounds are\nattained precisely by the spaces whose unit balls are the regular hexagon and\ndodecahedron. In fact, a general inequality for the projection constant of a\nreal or complex $n$-dimensional space is obtained and the question of equality\ntherein is discussed.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 92"}
{"prompt": "  In Banach space theory, the ``local theory'' refers to the collection of\nfinite dimensional methods and ideas which are used to study infinite\ndimensional spaces (see e.g. [P4,TJ]). It is natural to try to develop an\nanalogous theory in the recently developed category of operator spaces\n[BP,B1-2,BS,ER1-7,Ru]. The object of this paper is to start such a theory. We\nplan to present a more thorough discussion of the associated tensor norms in a\nfuture publication.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 92"}
{"prompt": "  This paper describes a user-friendly frontend to a Fortran program that\nintegrates coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The user\ninterface is built using the NeXTstep Interface Builder, together with a\npublic-domain graphical palette for displaying intermediate and final results.\nIn running the code for a given set of equation parameters the user sees a plot\nof the solutions at each stage of the iterative process. In the case of a\nsuccessful sequence of iterations, the initially discontinuous curves smooth\nout as the scale parameters of the solutions are adjusted to achieve a solution\nto the nonlinear equations. If the iterative process goes astray, as it often\ndoes for a poor choice of starting scale parameters, the user has the\nopportunity to stop and start over with a better choice, guided by the result\nof the previous run. The ease of interaction with the equations also allows the\nuser to develop an intuition regarding their solutions and to explore the\nparameter space for the equations much more quickly.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 92"}
{"prompt": "  The influence of relativity on the triton binding energy is investigated. The\nrelativistic three-dimensional version of the Bethe-Salpeter equation proposed\nby Blankenbecler and Sugar (BbS) is used. Relativistic (non-separable)\none-boson-exchange potentials (constructed in the BbS framework) are employed\nfor the two-nucleon interaction. In a 34-channel Faddeev calculation, it is\nfound that relativistic effects increase the triton binding energy by about 0.2\nMeV. Including charge-dependence (besides relativity), the final triton binding\nenergy predictions are 8.33 and 8.16 MeV for the Bonn A and B potential,\nrespectively.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 92"}
{"prompt": "  The structure functions calculated in the Chiral bag model reproduce quite\nwell, after appropriate perturbative evolution to large energy scales, the\nexperimental data. We use these results to interpret the structure of the $EMC$\ndata as a quenching of the pion decay constant due to the in medium behavior of\nthe nucleon. This explanation supports recent proposals of this phenomenon\nwhose origin is the scale invariance of the $QCD$ lagrangian.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 92"}

{"prompt": "  We derive closed form kaon-nucleon scattering amplitudes using the ``quark\nBorn diagram\" formalism, which describes the scattering as a single interaction\n(here the OGE spin-spin term) followed by quark line rearrangement. The low\nenergy I=0 and I=1 S-wave KN phase shifts are in reasonably good agreement with\nexperiment given conventional quark model parameters. For $k_{lab}> 0.7$ Gev\nhowever the I=1 elastic phase shift is larger than predicted by Gaussian\nwavefunctions, and we suggest possible reasons for this discrepancy. Equivalent\nlow energy KN potentials for S-wave scattering are also derived. Finally we\nconsider OGE forces in the related channels K$\\Delta$, K$^*$N and K$^*\\Delta$,\nand determine which have attractive interactions and might therefore exhibit\nstrong threshold enhancements or ``Z$^*$-molecule\" meson-baryon bound states.\nWe find that the minimum-spin, minimum-isospin channels and two additional\nK$^*\\Delta$ channels are most conducive to the formation of bound states.\nRelated interesting topics for future experimental and theoretical studies of\nKN interactions are also discussed.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 92"}
