{"prompt": "  Aims: Propagation and energy transfer of torsional Alfv\\'en waves in solar\nmagnetic flux tubes of axial symmetry is studied. Methods: An analytical model\nof a solar magnetic flux tube of axial symmetry is developed by specifying a\nmagnetic flux and deriving general analytical formulae for the equilibrium mass\ndensity and a gas pressure. The main advantage of this model is that it can be\neasily adopted to any axisymmetric magnetic structure. The model is used to\nsimulate numerically the propagation of nonlinear Alfv\\'en waves in such 2D\nflux tubes of axial symmetry embedded in the solar atmosphere. The waves are\nexcited by a localized pulse in the azimuthal component of velocity and\nlaunched at the top of the solar photosphere, and they propagate through the\nsolar chromosphere, transition region, and into the solar corona. Results: The\nresults of our numerical simulations reveal a complex scenario of twisted\nmagnetic field lines and flows associated with torsional Alfv\\'en waves as well\nas energy transfer to the magnetoacoustic waves that are triggered by the\nAlfv\\'en waves and are akin to the vertical jet flows. Alfv\\'en waves\nexperience about 5 % amplitude reflection at the transition region. Magnetic\n(velocity) field perturbations experience attenuation (growth) with height is\nagreement with analytical findings. Kinetic energy of magnetoacoustic waves\nconsists of 25 % of the total energy of Alfv\\'en waves. The energy transfer may\nlead to localized mass transport in the form of vertical jets, as well as to\nlocalized heating as slow magnetoacoustic waves are prone to dissipation in the\ninner corona.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2015"}

Use of effective testing\nmethods to obtain information about physical properties of different liquids on\nthe molecular level is one of the most important problems in biophysics.\nHowever, the standard methods based on the microwave resonant techniques are\nnot sufficiently suitable for biological liquids because the resonance peak in\na resonator with high-loss liquids is so broad that the material parameters\ncannot be measured correctly. Although molecular vibrations of biomolecules may\nhave microwave frequencies, it is not thought that such resonant coupling is\nsignificant due to their low energy compared with thermal energy and the\nstrongly dampening aqueous environment. This paper presents an innovative\nmicrowave sensing technique for different types of lossy materials, including\nbiological liquids.

When\nfrequency of the magnetic-dipolar-mode (MDM) resonance is not equal to the\ncavity resonance frequency, one gets Fano transmission intensity.

{"prompt": "  Several data mining problems are characterized by data in high dimensions.\nOne of the popular ways to reduce the dimensionality of the data is to perform\nfeature selection, i.e, select a subset of relevant and non-redundant features.\nRecently, Quadratic Programming Feature Selection (QPFS) has been proposed\nwhich formulates the feature selection problem as a quadratic program. It has\nbeen shown to outperform many of the existing feature selection methods for a\nvariety of applications. Though, better than many existing approaches, the\nrunning time complexity of QPFS is cubic in the number of features, which can\nbe quite computationally expensive even for moderately sized datasets. In this\npaper we propose a novel method for feature selection by integrating k-means\nclustering with QPFS. The basic variant of our approach runs k-means to bring\ndown the number of features which need to be passed on to QPFS. We then enhance\nthis idea, wherein we gradually refine the feature space from a very coarse\nclustering to a fine-grained one, by interleaving steps of QPFS with k-means\nclustering. Every step of QPFS helps in identifying the clusters of irrelevant\nfeatures (which can then be thrown away), whereas every step of k-means further\nrefines the clusters which are potentially relevant. We show that our iterative\nrefinement of clusters is guaranteed to converge. We provide bounds on the\nnumber of distance computations involved in the k-means algorithm. Further,\neach QPFS run is now cubic in number of clusters, which can be much smaller\nthan actual number of features. Experiments on eight publicly available\ndatasets show that our approach gives significant computational gains (both in\ntime and memory), over standard QPFS as well as other state of the art feature\nselection methods, even while improving the overall accuracy.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2015"}
{"prompt": "  Distributed RDF systems partition data across multiple computer nodes\n(workers). Some systems perform cheap hash partitioning, which may result in\nexpensive query evaluation, while others apply heuristics aiming at minimizing\ninter-node communication during query evaluation. This requires an expensive\ndata preprocessing phase, leading to high startup costs for very large RDF\nknowledge bases. Apriori knowledge of the query workload has also been used to\ncreate partitions, which however are static and do not adapt to workload\nchanges; hence, inter-node communication cannot be consistently avoided for\nqueries that are not favored by the initial data partitioning.\n  In this paper, we propose AdHash, a distributed RDF system, which addresses\nthe shortcomings of previous work. First, AdHash applies lightweight\npartitioning on the initial data, that distributes triples by hashing on their\nsubjects; this renders its startup overhead low. At the same time, the\nlocality-aware query optimizer of AdHash takes full advantage of the\npartitioning to (i)support the fully parallel processing of join patterns on\nsubjects and (ii) minimize data communication for general queries by applying\nhash distribution of intermediate results instead of broadcasting, wherever\npossible. Second, AdHash monitors the data access patterns and dynamically\nredistributes and replicates the instances of the most frequent ones among\nworkers. As a result, the communication cost for future queries is drastically\nreduced or even eliminated. To control replication, AdHash implements an\neviction policy for the redistributed patterns. Our experiments with synthetic\nand real data verify that AdHash (i) starts faster than all existing systems,\n(ii) processes thousands of queries before other systems become online, and\n(iii) gracefully adapts to the query load, being able to evaluate queries on\nbillion-scale RDF data in sub-seconds.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2015"}

Such\ntechniques are valuable since they allow to handle even more complex systems.\nOne key point is the ability to decompose a large system into subsystems,\nanalyze those subsystems and deduce properties of the larger system. As\ncyber-physical systems tend to become more and more complex, such techniques\nbecome more appealing.\n  In 2009, Oehlerking and Theel presented a (de-)composition technique for\nhybrid systems. This technique is graph-based and constructs a Lyapunov\nfunction for hybrid systems having a complex discrete state space. The\ntechnique consists of (1) decomposing the underlying graph of the hybrid system\ninto subgraphs, (2) computing multiple local Lyapunov functions for the\nsubgraphs, and finally (3) composing the local Lyapunov functions into a\npiecewise Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function can serve multiple purposes,\ne.g., it certifies stability or termination of a system or allows to construct\ninvariant sets, which in turn may be used to certify safety and security.\n  In this paper, we propose an improvement to the decomposing technique, which\nrelaxes the graph structure before applying the decomposition technique.

We consider the case of surveys for high-redshift\nLyman-alpha-emitting galaxies (LAEs), which have traditionally been classified\nvia an inferred rest-frame equivalent width (EW) greater than 20 angstrom. Our\nBayesian method relies on known prior probabilities in measured emission-line\nluminosity functions and equivalent width distributions for the galaxy\npopulations, and returns the probability that an object in question is an LAE\ngiven the characteristics observed. This approach will be directly relevant for\nthe Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX), which seeks to\nclassify ~10^6 emission-line galaxies into LAEs and low-redshift [O II]\nemitters. For a simulated HETDEX catalog with realistic measurement noise, our\nBayesian method recovers 86% of LAEs missed by the traditional EW > 20 angstrom\ncutoff over 2 < z < 3, outperforming the EW cut in both contamination and\nincompleteness. This is due to the method's ability to trade off between the\ntwo types of binary classification error by adjusting the stringency of the\nprobability requirement for classifying an observed object as an LAE. In our\nsimulations of HETDEX, this method reduces the uncertainty in cosmological\ndistance measurements by 14% with respect to the EW cut, equivalent to\nrecovering 29% more cosmological information. Rather than using binary object\nlabels, this method enables the use of classification probabilities in\nlarge-scale structure analyses.

{"prompt": "  The entropy of a digraph is a fundamental measure which relates network\ncoding, information theory, and fixed points of finite dynamical systems. In\nthis paper, we focus on the entropy of undirected graphs. We prove that for any\ninteger $k$ the number of possible values of the entropy of an undirected graph\nup to $k$ is finite. We also determine all the possible values for the entropy\nof an undirected graph up to the value of four.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2015"}
{"prompt": "  As an application of P. Delgine's theorem (Esnault and Kerz in Acta Math.\nVietnam. 37:531-562, 2012) on a finiteness of $l$-adic sheaves on a variety\nover a finite field, we show the finiteness of \\'etale coverings of such a\nvariety with given degree whose ramification bounded along an effective Cartier\ndivisor. This can be thought of a higher dimensional analogue of the classical\nHermite-Minkowski theorem.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2015"}
{"prompt": "  The complex scaling method (CSM) provides with a way to obtain resonance\nparameters of particle unstable states by rotating the coordinates and momenta\nof the original Hamiltonian. It is convenient to use an L$^2$ integrable basis\nto resolve the complex rotated or complex scaled Hamiltonian H$_{\\theta}$, with\n$\\theta$ being the angle of rotation in the complex energy plane. Within the\nCSM, resonance and scattering solutions do not exhibit an outgoing or\nscattering wave asymptotic behavior, but rather have decaying asymptotics. One\nof the consequences is that, expectation values of operators in a resonance or\nscattering complex scaled solution are calculated by complex rotating the\noperators. In this work we are exploring applications of the CSM on\ncalculations of expectation values of quantum mechanical operators by\nretrieving the Gamow asymptotic character of the decaying state and calculating\nhence the expectation value using the unrotated operator. The test cases\ninvolve a schematic two-body Gaussian model and also applications using\nrealistic interactions.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2015"}
{"prompt": "  The first challenge in robustness analysis of large-scale interconnected\nuncertain systems is to provide a model of such systems in a standard-form that\nis required within different analysis frameworks. This becomes particularly\nimportant for large-scale systems, as analysis tools that can handle such\nsystems heavily rely on the special structure within such model descriptions.\nWe here propose an automated framework for providing such models of large-scale\ninterconnected uncertain systems that are used in Integral Quadratic Constraint\n(IQC) analysis. Specifically, in this paper we put forth a methodological way\nto provide such models from a block-diagram and nested description of\ninterconnected uncertain systems. We describe the details of this automated\nframework using an example.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2015"}
{"prompt": "  The Effelsberg-Bonn HI Survey (EBHIS) is a new 21-cm survey performed with\nthe 100-m telescope at Effelsberg. It covers the whole northern sky out to a\nredshift of z~0.07 and comprises HI line emission from the Milky Way and the\nLocal Volume. We aim to substitute the northern-hemisphere part of the\nLeiden/Argentine/Bonn Milky Way HI survey (LAB) with this first EBHIS data\nrelease, which presents the HI gas in the Milky Way regime. The use of a\nseven-beam L-band array made it feasible to perform this all-sky survey with a\n100-m class telescope in a reasonable amount of observing time.\nState-of-the-art fast-Fourier-transform spectrometers provide the necessary\ndata read-out speed, dynamic range, and spectral resolution to apply software\nradio-frequency interference mitigation. EBHIS is corrected for stray radiation\nand employs frequency-dependent flux-density calibration and sophisticated\nbaseline-removal techniques to ensure the highest possible data quality.\nDetailed analyses of the resulting data products show that EBHIS is not only\noutperforming LAB in terms of sensitivity and angular resolution, but also\nmatches the intensity-scale of LAB extremely well, allowing EBHIS to be used as\na drop-in replacement for LAB. Data products are made available to the public\nin a variety of forms. Most important, we provide a properly gridded Milky Way\nHI column density map in HEALPix representation. To maximize the usefulness of\nEBHIS data, we estimate uncertainties in the HI column density and brightness\ntemperature distributions, accounting for systematic effects.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2015"}
{"prompt": "  Information theory has been taken as a prospective tool for quantifying the\ncomplexity of complex networks. In this paper, we first study the information\nentropy or uncertainty of a path using the information theory. Then we apply\nthe path entropy to the link prediction problem in real-world networks.\nSpecifically, we propose a new similarity index, namely Path Entropy (PE)\nindex, which considers the information entropies of shortest paths between node\npairs with penalization to long paths. Empirical experiments demonstrate that\nPE index outperforms the mainstream link predictors.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2015"}
{"prompt": "  Circular Electron-Positron Collider(CEPC) is one of the largest plans in high\nenergy physics study at China, which would serve as Higgs Factory firstly and\nthen upgrade to a hadron collider.

Also, we give the\npotential of CEPC running at $Z$ and $W$ poles.

{"prompt": "  The celebrated hook-length formula gives a product formula for the number of\nstandard Young tableaux of a straight shape. In 2014, Naruse announced a more\ngeneral formula for the number of standard Young tableaux of skew shapes as a\npositive sum over excited diagrams of products of hook-lengths. We give an\nalgebraic and a combinatorial proof of Naruse's formula, by using factorial\nSchur functions and a generalization of the Hillman--Grassl correspondence,\nrespectively.\n  The main new results are two different $q$-analogues of Naruse's formula: for\nthe skew Schur functions, and for counting reverse plane partitions of skew\nshapes. We establish explicit bijections between these objects and families of\ninteger arrays with certain nonzero entries, which also proves the second\nformula.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2015"}
{"prompt": "  For about a decade, the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) peak at about 105\nMpc/h has provided a standard ruler test of the LCDM cosmological model, a\nmember of the Friedmann--Lemaitre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) family of\ncosmological models---according to which comoving space is rigid. However,\ngeneral relativity does not require comoving space to be rigid. During the\nvirialisation epoch, when the most massive structures form by gravitational\ncollapse, it should be expected that comoving space evolves inhomogeneous\ncurvature as structure grows. The BAO peak standard ruler should also follow\nthis inhomogeneous evolution if the comoving rigidity assumption is false. This\n\"standard\" ruler has now been detected to be flexible, as expected under\ngeneral relativity.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "2015"}
