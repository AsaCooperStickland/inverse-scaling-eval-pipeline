B 56, 12847 (1997)) that the bands of\ninterest should form an isolated group, separated by gaps from higher and lower\nbands everywhere in the Brillouin zone. An energy window encompassing N bands\nof interest is specified by the user, and the algorithm then proceeds to\ndisentangle these from the remaining bands inside the window by filtering out\nan optimally connected N-dimensional subspace. This is achieved by minimizing a\nfunctional that measures the subspace dispersion across the Brillouin zone.

{"prompt": "  We study the truncated Wigner method (TWM) applied to a weakly interacting\nBose condensed gas perturbed away from thermal equilibrium. The idea of the\nmethod is to generate an ensemble of classical fields which samples the Wigner\nfunction of the initial thermal density operator, and to evolve each field with\nthe Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). In the first part of the paper we improve\nthe sampling technique over our previous work and we test its accuracy against\nthe exactly solvable model of the ideal gas. In the second part of the paper we\ninvestigate the conditions of validity of the TWM. For short evolution times\nthe time-dependent Bogoliubov approximation is valid for almost pure\ncondensates. The requirement that the TWM reproduces the Bogoliubov prediction\nleads to the constraint that the number of field modes must be smaller than the\nnumber of particles.For longer times the nonlinear dynamics of the noncondensed\nmodes plays an important role. To demonstrate this we analyse the case of a 3D\nspatially homogeneous Bose condensed gas and we test how well TWM reproduces\nBeliaev-Landau damping.We have identified the mechanism which limits the\nvalidity of the TWM: the initial classical fields, driven by the time-dependent\nGPE, thermalise to a classical field distribution at a temperature T_class\nlarger than the initial temperature T. When T_class significantly exceeds T a\nspurious damping is observed in the simulation. This leads to the second\ncondition for the TWM, T_class-T<<T, which requires that the maximum energy of\nthe Bogoliubov modes does not exceed a few k_B T.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20co"}

This circuit has a\nspecial bias point where the Larmor frequency is, to first order, insensitive\nto fluctuations in the bias parameters -- the charge of the box island and the\nphase of the large junction. At this optimal working point, the state of the\nqubit can be determined by dispersive measurements that probe the second\nderivative of the state energy with respect to these bias parameters. We use\nthe quantronium phase degree of freedom to perform a non-linear, dispersive\nmeasurement of its inductive response using bifurcation amplification. This\nnovel readout projects the state of the qubit in a few nanoseconds, and its\nlatching property allows us to record the resulting information in a few\nhundred nanoseconds. We have measured, using this technique, Rabi oscillations\nand Ramsey fringes with an improved signal to noise ratio and contrast.

The NMTO method allows one to solve the single-electron Schroedinger\nequation for a MT-potential -in which the MT-wells may overlap- using basis\nsets which are arbitrarily minimal. The substantial increase in accuracy over\nthe LMTO-ASA method is achieved by substitution of the energy-dependent partial\nwaves by so-called kinked partial waves, which have tails attached to them, and\nby using these kinked partial waves at N+1 arbitrary energies to construct the\nset of NMTOs.
