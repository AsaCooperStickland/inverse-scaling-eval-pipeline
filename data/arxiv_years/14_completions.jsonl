{"prompt": "  Hochster's theta invariant is defined for a pair of finitely generated\nmodules on a hypersurface ring having only an isolated singularity. Up to a\nsign, it agrees with the Euler invariant of a pair of matrix factorizations.\n  Working over the complex numbers, Buchweitz and van Straten have established\nan interesting connection between Hochster's theta invariant and the classical\nlinking form on the link of the singularity. In particular, they establish the\nvanishing of the theta invariant if the hypersurface is even-dimensional by\nexploiting the fact that the (reduced) cohomology of the Milnor fiber is\nconcentrated in odd degrees in this situation.\n  In this paper, we give purely algebraic versions of some of these results.

In this thesis, we resolve a\nmajor part of this issue by describing general techniques that allow to\nquantify the attainable precision in metrological schemes in the presence of\nuncorrelated noise. We show that the abstract geometrical structure of a\nquantum channel describing the noisy evolution of a single particle dictates\nthen critical bounds on the ultimate quantum enhancement.

We performed an analysis of the published radial\nvelocity measurements for Kepler-78 in order to derive a refined measurement\nfor the planet mass. Kepler-78 is an active star and radial velocity variations\ndue to activity were removed using a Floating Chunk Offset (FCO) method where\nan orbital solution was made to the data by allowing the velocity offsets of\nindividual nights to vary. We show that if we had no a priori knowledge of the\ntransit period the FCO method used as a periodogram would still have detected\nKepler-78b in the radial velocity data. It can thus be effective at finding\nunknown short-period signals in the presence of significant activity noise.\nUsing the FCO method while keeping the ephemeris and orbital phase fixed to the\nphotometric values and using only data from nights where 6-10 measurements were\ntaken results in a K-amplitude of 1.34 +/- 0.25 m/s. a planet mass of 1.31 +/-\n0.24 M_Earth, and a planet density of rho = 4.5 (-2.0/+2.2) g/cm^3. Allowing\nthe orbital phase to be a free parameter reproduces the transit phase to within\nthe uncertainty. The corresponding density implies that Kepler-78b may have a\nstructure that is deficient in iron and is thus more like the Moon. Although\nthe various approaches that were used to filter out the activity of Kepler 78\nproduce consistent radial velocity amplitudes to within the errors, these are\nstill too large to constrain the structure of this planet. The uncertainty in\nthe mass for Kepler-78b is large enough to encompass models with structures\nranging from Mercury-like (iron enriched) to Moon-like (iron deficient). A more\naccurate K-amplitude as well as a better determination of the planet radius are\nneeded to distinguish between these models.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 13"}

{"prompt": "  The dynamics of the reaction H + OH $\\to$ O (3P) + H2 have been studied in a\nseries of quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) calculations and transition state\ntheory (TST) methods using high quality 3A' and 3A'' potential energy surfaces\n(PESs). Accurate OH (v, j) state resolved cross sections and rate constants on\nboth potential energy surfaces are presented and fitted for OH at (v = 0, j =\n0-16) and (v = 1, j = 0-6). The cross sections were calculated for different\ncollisional energies (Ec), ranging from the threshold energy at each specific\nrovibrational state up to 1.0 eV with step sizes of 0.1 eV or less. They\nincrease steeply with collision energy when the barrier to reaction can be\novercome, after which the cross sections stay nearly constant with energy.\nState resolved rate constants in the temperature range 200-2500 K are presented\nbased on the cross sections. Total thermal rate constants were calculated by\nsumming the rates for reaction on the 3A' and 3A'' potential energy surfaces\nweighted by 1/3 and taking into account the thermal populations of the\nrovibrational states of the OH molecules. It is shown that the improved\ncanonical variational transition (CVT) treatments with the approximation of\nzero-curvature tunneling (ZCT) or small-curvature tunneling (SCT) produce\nresults more in accord with the QCT results than the TST and CVT methods. The\nreactions are governed by the direct reaction mechanism. The rate constants for\nOH in excited vibrational and rotational states are orders of magnitude larger\nthan the thermal rate constants, which needs to be taken into account in\nastrochemical models.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 10"}

This paper seeks to identify weaknesses in the third model,\nas it claims to offer 100% user data confidentiality throughout all data\ntransactions (e.g., upload, download, sharing) through a combination of Network\nTraffic Analysis, Source Code Decompilation, and Source Code Disassembly.

Moreover, velocity-strengthening friction has very\nrecently been linked to slow laboratory earthquakes and stick-slip motion. Here\nwe elucidate the importance of velocity-strengthening friction by theoretically\nstudying three variants of a realistic rate-and-state friction model. All\nvariants feature identical logarithmic velocity-weakening friction at small\nsliding velocities, but differ in their higher velocity behaviors.

The first method relies on mutual planet-moon events during stellar\ntransits.

Effective temperatures for our targets are determined from all\nwell-sampled observing epochs and are based on a V-I_C color-index calibration.\nThe effective temperature change between the extrema of the rotational\nmodulation for IL Hya and XX Tri is in the range 50-200 K. The bolometric flux\nduring maximum of the rotational modulation, i.e., the least spotted states,\nvaried by up to 39% in IL Hya and up to 54% in XX Tri over the course of our\nobservations. We emphasize that for IL Hya this is just about half of the total\nluminosity variation that can be explained by the photospheric temperature\n(spots/faculae) changes, while for XX Tri it is even about one third. The\nlong-term, 0.6 mag V-band variation of DM UMa is more difficult to explain\nbecause little or no B-V color index change is observed on the same timescale.\nPlacing the three stars with their light and color variations into H-R\ndiagrams, we find that their overall luminosities are generally too low\ncompared to predictions from current evolutionary tracks. A change in the\nstellar radius due to strong and variable magnetic fields during activity\ncycles likely plays a role in explaining the anomalous brightness and\nluminosity of our three targets. At least for IL Hya, a radius change of about\n9% is suggested from m_bol and T_eff, and is supported by independent vsin(i)\nmeasurements.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 04"}

Using non-resonant excitation, it is thus possible to obtain\ncondensate injection pulses with a record frequency of 0:1 THz.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 06"}

The\nmost widely used approach to this problem is to convert strings into numerical\nvectors using string kernels and subsequently apply a support vector machine\nthat works in a numerical vector space. However, this non-one-to-one conversion\ninvolves a loss of information and makes it impossible to evaluate, using\nprobability theory, the generalization error of a learning machine, considering\nthat the given data to train and test the machine are strings generated\naccording to probability laws. In this study, we approach this classification\nproblem by constructing a classifier that works in a set of strings.

Therefore, we first extend a limit\ntheorem on the asymptotic behavior of a consensus sequence of strings, which is\nthe counterpart of the mean of numerical vectors, as demonstrated in the\nprobability theory on a metric space of strings developed by one of the authors\nand his colleague in a previous study [18].
