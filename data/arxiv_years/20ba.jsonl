{"prompt": "  In this thesis, a Bayes linear methodology for the adjustment of covariance\nmatrices is presented and discussed. A geometric framework for quantifying\nuncertainties about covariance matrices is set up, and an inner-product for\nspaces of random matrices is motivated and constructed. The inner-product on\nthis space captures aspects of our beliefs about the relationship between\ncovariance matrices of interest to us, providing a structure rich enough for us\nto adjust beliefs about unknown matrices in the light of data such as sample\ncovariance matrices, exploiting second-order exchangeability and related\nspecifications to obtain representations allowing analysis.\n  Adjustment is associated with orthogonal projection, and illustrated with\nexamples of adjustments for some common problems. The problem of adjusting the\ncovariance matrices underlying exchangeable random vectors is tackled and\ndiscussed. Learning about the covariance matrices associated with multivariate\ntime series dynamic linear models is shown to be amenable to a similar\napproach. Diagnostics for matrix adjustments are also discussed.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20ba"}
