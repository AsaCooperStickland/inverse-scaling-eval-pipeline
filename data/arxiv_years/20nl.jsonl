{"prompt": "  We consider an evolution operator for a discrete Langevin equation with a\nstrongly hyperbolic classical dynamics and Gaussian noise. Using an integral\nrepresentation of the evolution operator we investigate the high order\ncorrections to the trace of arbitary power of the operator.\n  The asymptotic behaviour is found to be controlled by sub-dominant saddle\npoints previously neglected in the perturbative expansion.

{"prompt": "  We study the topological entropy of chaotic repellers formed by those points\nin a given chaotic attractor that never visit some small forbidden hole-region\nin the phase space. The hole is a set of points in the phase space that have a\nsequence $\\alpha=(\\alpha_0\\alpha_1...\\alpha_{l-1})$ as the first $l$ letters in\ntheir itineraries. We point out that the difference between the topological\nentropies of the attractor and the embedded repeller is for most choices of\n$\\alpha$ approximately equal to the Parry measure corresponding to $\\alpha$,\n$\\mu_P(\\alpha)$. When the hole encompasses a point of a short periodic orbit,\nthe entropy difference is significantly smaller than $\\mu_P(\\alpha)$. This\ndiscrepancy is described by the formula which relates the length of the short\nperiodic orbit, the Parry measure $\\mu_P(\\alpha)$, and the topological\nentropies of the two chaotic sets.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20nl"}
{"prompt": "  In a recent paper, wavelet analysis was used to perturb the coupling matrix\nin an array of identical chaotic systems in order to improve its\nsynchronization. As the synchronization criterion is determined by the second\nsmallest eigenvalue $\\lambda_2$ of the coupling matrix, the problem is\nequivalent to studying how $\\lambda_2$ of the coupling matrix changes with\nperturbation. In the aforementioned paper, a small percentage of the wavelet\ncoefficients are modified. However, this result in a perturbed matrix where\nevery element is modified and nonzero. The purpose of this paper is to present\nsome results on the change of $\\lambda_2$ due to perturbation. In particular,\nwe show that as the number of systems $n \\to \\infty$, perturbations which only\nadd local coupling will not change $\\lambda_2$. On the other hand, we show that\nthere exists perturbations which affect an arbitrarily small percentage of\nmatrix elements, each of which is changed by an arbitrarily small amount and\nyet can make $\\lambda_2$ arbitrarily large. These results give conditions on\nwhat the perturbation should be in order to improve the synchronizability in an\narray of coupled chaotic systems. This analysis allows us to prove and explain\nsome of the synchronization phenomena observed in a recently studied network\nwhere random coupling are added to a locally connected array. Finally we\nclassify various classes of coupling matrices such as small world networks and\nscale free networks according to their synchronizability in the limit.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20nl"}

{"prompt": "  A model of the passive vector field advected by the uncorrelated in time\nGaussian velocity with power-like covariance is studied by means of the\nrenormalization group and the operator product expansion. The structure\nfunctions of the admixture demonstrate essential power-like dependence on the\nexternal scale in the inertial range (the case of an anomalous scaling). The\nmethod of finding of independent tensor invariants in the cases of two and\nthree dimensions is proposed to eliminate linear dependencies between the\noperators entering into the operator product expansions of the structure\nfunctions. The constructed operator bases, which include the powers of the\ndissipation operator and the enstrophy operator, provide the possibility to\ncalculate the exponents of the anomalous scaling.\n\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "20nl"}
